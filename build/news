Notable Messari Governor Updates

The Sushi DAO has &lt;a href=&#34;https://messari.io/governor/proposal/275003b6-2982-43e8-b66f-29cd4bbda30d&#34;&gt;submitted a proposal&lt;/a&gt; that outlines a 4-year restructuring plan for the Sushi organization and earmarks a budget of 6 million SUSHI to fund contributors, future hires, and strategy and project leadership during that time. The proposal expands the developer team from 4 to 10 full-time contributors. It launches a Compensation Committee responsible for managing compensation negotiations, establishing roles, reviewing performance, approving budget requests, and more. Preliminary discussions are ongoing.
Redacted Cartel has &lt;a href=&#34;https://messari.io/governor/proposal/bc146c70-9155-469e-90aa-42d37366db36&#34;&gt;submitted a proposal&lt;/a&gt; that aims to introduce Redacted V2 tokenomics and establish a fixed supply of 5 million BTRFLY, a new token supply schedule, and a transition from a rebase model to a vote-escrow model using rlBTRFLY. BTRFLY holders can lock their tokens for rlBTRFLY, which will receive BTRFLY and a share of protocol revenue. Preliminary discussions are ongoing.

The 10 million RBN will be initially used to pursue professional market makers for deeper RBN liquidity on CEXs, as well as other programs to increase Ribbon exposure. Voting is currently active.
The BitDAO has &lt;a href=&#34;https://messari.io/governor/proposal/c683293e-e21b-4909-b4da-3db800e4e430&#34;&gt;submitted a proposal&lt;/a&gt; that seeks community approval to launch the BIT Purchase Program to increase the economic connection between BitDAO Treasury growth and the BIT token. The BIT Purchase Program will introduce a Targeted Daily Purchase Amount (TDPA) of $700,000 (approximately $21 million per month). Voting is currently active.
The IndexCoop DAO has &lt;a href=&#34;https://messari.io/governor/proposal/a8a1efd8-0e68-405e-908c-9e5dcad67154&#34;&gt;succeeded in passing a proposal&lt;/a&gt; that seeks to approve the incorporation of Index Cooperative. The aim is to set up a corporate structure for the DAO to create limited liability protection for contributors, open opportunities for partnerships and off-chain activity with organizations that will only enter into a contract or engage with a legal entity, and comply with applicable tax laws.

  

Sector Returns

All sectors ended the week in the red as more fear sets in on the markets. Markets last week were showing signs of consolidation, which could indicate that big moves would be coming ahead. Judging from market sentiment, the moves could be in the downward direction. Losses this week ranged from -2.24% to -11.06% as the gaming sector took the biggest hit.

Top Assets

Dogecoin (DOGE) was the only top asset by market capitalization that ended the week with a positive return. Just like the rest of the assets within the category, DOGE was trending downwards mid-week and was heading towards a 10% loss. However, markets went on a brief rally, and the original dog coin saw its price rise by as much as 36.2% following news that Elon Musk would be acquiring Twitter. DOGE has given back most of the gains since and finished the week just slightly above where it started (1.2%). 

DeFi Assets

The top DeFi sector assets went through a decline this week with the exception of two outliers — Kava (KAVA) and Curve (CRV). CRV started the week on solid footing as it achieved a 15% gain quickly and subsequently peaking at 22% by mid-week. The token lost momentum soon after and its price started to taper off; however, this was enough to secure its position in second place. On the other hand, KAVA, the Tendermint-based Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain’s native asset, started the week around -5% territory but recovered lost ground and followed a steady trend upwards, only surpassing CRV’s price at the last moment. It was the sector leader this week with a 15.1% return.

Smart Contract Platforms

It was all red for the smart contract platform sector as all of its top assets finished the week underwater. Losses this week ranged from -1.1% all the way down to -20.3%. Ethereum (ETH) declined the least within the sector. Its token price visited the 5% decline territory at one point but was able to recover lost ground, finishing the week slightly below where it started. Interestingly, the two projects which recently announced that they will be launching their own native LUNA/UST-like algo stablecoins were the biggest losers this week. TRON (TRON) and NEAR (NEAR) ended the week with corresponding 11.3% and 20.3% declines.

Currencies

Similar to the top assets by market capitalization category, the currencies sector only had one asset end the week with a positive return. Dogecoin (DOGE) has benefitted from the string of media coverage that one of its biggest proponents, Elon Musk, has recently been receiving. News that Twitter accepted Elon Musk’s buyout offer was enough to propel DOGE 36.2% from its weekly low. Although most of the gains have been returned, it was enough to secure the leading position within the sector. 

Web3

The Web3 sector had a rocky week as most of the top assets had significant price action. Only The Graph (GRT) was able to end the week in positive territory. The decentralized indexing protocol’s token ended the week with a 2.2% return. The rest of the sector’s top assets saw losses ranging from 4.7% down to 14.7% with Theta Network’s THETA token being the laggard of the group.

Gaming

The gaming sector was the worst performer of the week and the only one with a double-digit decline (11.1%). The sector appeared on track to have all its top assets end the week in the red; however, Yield Guild Games’ token YGG had a 20% price rally at the last moment that was enough to secure its position as the top performer with a 2.3% return. Axie Infinity (AXS) lagged the group this week with a 17.3% decline.

Key Insights

With over 12,000 daily active users, Decentral Games is more active than most decentralized metaverses.
Decentral Games operates on Polygon and is integrated within the Polygon Studios gaming and NFT ecosystem.
ICE Poker is the main game in the Decentral Games ecosystem. It earned $36 million in Q1 2022 from NFT activations, NFT mints, secondary sales fees, and in-game upgrades fees.
Important governance decisions made in Q1 2022 include adding in-game ads, featuring NFT mints in ICE, the native in-game currency, instead of ETH, and changing reward distributions.
The forthcoming launch of a simplified game mode via mobile app is expected to further increase the game’s user base.

Poker rooms typically make their revenue from commission fees called a rake. It’s the cost of doing business, but there’s usually still some disgruntlement by players about this; after all, the operator is effectively applying a tax on the game. So what about a poker room where a rake doesn’t need to be applied? Or even, what about a poker room where players don’t have to lose anything at all?

Decentral Games in a Nutshell

Decentral Games is a game operator within Decentraland, a 3-D browser-based world. It’s designed to reward users through a play-to-earn mechanism. Those who commit time to play the game are given the means to build a collection of assets worth real-world money. Both fungible and non-fungible assets are incorporated within Decentral Games — users can self-custody assets, earn yield-based rewards, and take ownership of their in-game items.

Underneath the hood, Decentral Games uses Polygon as its scaling solution. A multifaceted partnership exists between the two entities: Decentral Games deploys its games on the Polygon network and is a member of Polygon Studio’s ecosystem. The game platform also runs its own Polygon node.

The most successful game offered in the Decentral Games ecosystem is ICE Poker. It’s where the focus of the development team — and of this report — resides. ICE Poker was launched in October 2021 and is based on Texas hold’em, one of the most popular poker variations. Hold’em was chosen with the intent to bring in more users. ICE Poker aims to tap into an existing player pool by not requiring users to learn a new game. As a result, ICE Poker is among the most active and fastest-growing decentralized virtual worlds.

ICE Poker had approximately 8,000 daily active users in Q1 2022, up over 500% from the previous quarter. Not only did the ICE Poker game see a surge in users, the metric only reflects the average over the quarter and not the trend. The trend, meanwhile, highlights a steady increase in daily active users. Reaching 10,000 daily users for the first time in Q1 2022 is good evidence that ICE Poker is overcoming the usual lack of users that most decentralized metaverses face.

Notably, the last day of Q1 2022 did see a significant dip after reaching 12,000 daily active users before sharply rebounding in the beginning of April. This date coincided with the launch of a new feature, Assigned Seating, which launched with a few errant software bugs. Demand for Assigned Seating had been considerable, and after the bugs were fixed, daily users returned back to previous levels.

Wearable NFTs and Gameplay

To play ICE Poker, one needs to own or rent at least one in-game digital asset, i.e., a wearable NFT. Each wearable NFT starts as an ICE Rank 1 item (beginner) and can be upgraded up to ICE Rank 5 (colloquially known as diamond hand NFTs). Higher-ranked NFTs collect more rewards, which are paid out in ICE, the native in-game token. To move from one rank to another, owners must spend both ICE tokens and XP earned from completing gameplay challenges to level up their assets.

Source: Decentral Games

Players have the option of owning wearable NFTs outright (i.e., player-owner) or renting them (i.e., delegated player) from other NFT owners. Those with outright ownership may either acquire newly minted wearable NFTs or purchase them on secondary marketplaces like OpenSea (secondary sales). Ultimately, the decision remains a personal one. Poker players who are invested may want ownership of their own assets; meanwhile, metaverse “tourists” can choose to play without making any initial financial commitment. While delegated players face less risk, they have to split some of their earnings with the NFT owner.

Player Metrics and Rewards

Almost all games with in-game economies suffer from inflationary pressures. ICE Poker is no exception: as players spend more time in the game and rank higher on the leaderboard, they are more likely to receive greater ICE rewards. With ICE Poker finishing up its first full quarter, it’s worth tracking relevant in-game metrics. Let’s start by understanding the economic incentives for players first.

A visualization of the ecosystem’s economic engine is shown above. By accessing a wearable NFT, a player gets a daily allocation of chips. These chips can only be used for playing poker within ICE Poker. Notice players themselves don’t need to wager bets to play ICE Poker. Winning is measured in the number of ICE tokens earned. This essentially gives players a risk-free seat at the table: provided that players put the necessary time and effort into playing well, there is only upside potential. Each player is incentivized to perform a daily check-in, complete three daily challenges, and play well in exchange for ICE tokens and XP rewards. Gameplay rewards are calculated as follows:

Based on each player’s ranking on the daily leaderboard, a performance multiplier is applied to their earnings, which are paid in ICE. The higher a player ranks, the higher their ICE earnings.
Players may also get ICE based on their wearable NFTs. There are five different wearable NFT ranks, each with corresponding rewards.
At the end of each month, players who are at the top of the leaderboard can earn additional DG tokens, granting them increased governance and fee share in the DG ecosystem.

Decentral Games incentivizes ICE Poker players to reinvest their gameplay rewards into their own wearable NFT portfolios. Acquiring NFTs by primary sales requires people to mint the NFTs upon release. As of April 28, 2022, there have been 12 drops of ICE wearable NFTs dating back to November 2021. Each NFT drop is pegged with an associated label: recent names have been ICE Cyberpunk, ICE Spartan, and ICE Poet. Labels primarily exist to distinguish when the NFT was minted and don’t have any impact on functionality.

By opting for a controlled NFT release schedule, Decentral Games believes its vertical progression is more sustainable than the burning-to-breed models of other games. Supply is actively managed without the risk of exponential growth. Notably, most mints are uniformly distributed among buyers, with 50% of new NFTs ending up in wallets with only one wearable. That number surges even higher to 91% when filtering for new mints ending up in wallets with two or fewer total wearables.

A study of mint prices compared to the secondary sales price shows an opportunity for users to make a quick buck. In each of the 11 NFT drops we analyzed, the average secondary sales price was higher than the mint price. However, recent mints have become more expensive. For example, the average mint price of the first eight NFT drops was $1,237, while the average price for the last three NFT drops was $4,070. The higher starting price cuts into the eventual profits from flipping on the secondary market and encourages minters to utilize the NFT for non-speculative purposes instead.

Poker Participants

After renting or purchasing at least one wearable NFT, any user is granted table access. And although users can choose to either rent or purchase their wearable NFTs to gain table access, the ICE Poker ecosystem gains more when users purchase their NFTs. To incentivize player-owners to invest more resources into the ecosystem, ICE Poker encourages its users to upgrade their wearable NFTs.

Notably, over the past months, it has become increasingly affordable for player-owners to upgrade their wearable NFTs. Although a higher ICE Rank still costs more to upgrade than a lower ICE Rank, the price gaps are starting to shrink. The lower prices may have incentivized player-owners to upgrade more often.

Indeed, the general price decrease of upgrades coincided with a weekly 15% increase in the number of upgrades in recent months. It may thus be fair to discuss what benefits upgrades bring to player-owners. One might hypothesize that upgrades may correspond to generally higher prices for rarer wearable NFTs — intuitively, Rank 5 wearable NFTs should be more expensive to acquire on secondary markets than, for instance, those of Rank 1.

However, upon inspecting secondary sales prices, wearable NFT prices generally stabilize around the $5,000 range. On average, Rank 1 NFTs sold for the lowest prices, followed by Rank 5 NFTs. Conversely, NFTs of Ranks 3 and 4 sold for the highest prices. While this may be partly related to sample size, the behavior is still a surprising one.

Part of the explanation might be due to supply and demand. There were 3,487 sales of Rank 1 NFTs and 910 sales of Rank 5 NFTs in Q1 2022. Those volumes were multiples of the count for Rank 4 NFTs, which only had 79 transactions. Even Rank 3 NFTs only had 117 sales.

Another reason may be due to the gameplay itself. Purchasing a Rank 5 NFT could be seen as “cheating” the system; hardcore players might take this route to maximize reward, despite missing out on upgrade objectives. Altogether, there were 4,979 secondary sales in Q1 2022, which is significantly lower than the 9,477 total mints. These numbers suggest that there is not much selling activity — newly minted NFTs don’t usually change hands. Instead, player-owners are active poker players or have started to transition towards being guild owners who rent their wearable NFTs to other participants.

While gameplay requires a certain time investment, lending out wearable NFTs requires managing the performance of delegated players. The better those delegated players perform, the more revenue is accrued by a player-owner. Guild owners may find the second option attractive by choosing to delegate their guilds.

Guild Owners

ICE Poker enables guild owners to maximize their returns by tracking the performance of the delegated players via the Delegation Dashboard. Importantly, guilds don’t necessarily need to be wallets with dozens of NFTs; in the ICE poker ecosystem, a wallet with a single delegated NFT counts as a guild for the game’s tracking purposes.

On-chain data shows there are more than 4,000 guild wallets, making up 23% of all ICE Poker NFT-owning wallets. Approximately 1,500 of those guild wallets delegate one wearable NFT; another 1,500 delegates out two to four; and 600 rent out five to nine wearables. The resulting 400 guilds manage more than 10 wearables.

This data confirms Decentral Games’ aim of ensuring the gameplay ecosystem remains healthy in the long term. In this sense, ICE Poker did not do any pre-sale over-the-counter deals for industry insiders. Instead, ICE Poker wearable NFT drops were designed with a wide distribution in mind to incentivize gamers instead of tokenholders. That is, the goal is to incentivize the 77% of gameplay wallets to acquire their in-game wearable NFTs through organic mints or secondary sales. In doing so, the revenues generated by ICE Poker can be better sustained.

ICE Poker In-Game Economy

Approximately six months after the game’s launch, cumulative revenue from ICE Poker wearable NFTs reached over $40 million in Q1 2022. Minting accounts for the majority of ICE Poker revenue. In fact, almost 93% of ICE Poker revenue corresponds to mints and upgrades. The remaining 7% accounts for secondary sales and activations — this shows that only a small portion of revenues are accrued from the changing hands of wearable NFTs. Instead, once a wearable NFT is minted, most owners don’t sell them and prefer to use them in-game or rent them out.

On a daily basis, mint revenue can be overrepresented on NFT drop days. Those particular days are vital for the protocol because revenue from mints comprises more than 70% of ICE Poker’s cumulative revenue. For days without mints, upgrades then make up the majority of daily revenue.

The remaining two revenue streams (secondary sales and activations) make up for only a small fraction of protocol revenue. Combined, they max out to 50% of daily revenue but typically fall around 25% or less. This upgrade-heavy revenue model hints toward a healthy in-game economy where users are incentivized to upgrade, instead of cashing out and passing on their wearable NFTs to the next player.

Holistically, ICE Poker’s monetization strategy is analogous to those perfected by high-growing consumer tech companies. The first step is user acquisition, which is where ICE Poker is today. Once users are brought into the product and scale is achieved, activations and secondary sales may potentially become more tangible sources of revenue — and not just any revenue, but a recurring revenue that yields higher valuations and protocol stability.

Governance Updates

The management of the DG lounge is mostly left up to stakers of the DG token. Governance participants can vote on the use of proceeds, whitelist logic, partnerships, gameplay factors (such as point multipliers), and more. The following is a series of approved governance decisions with high protocol impact:

Jan. 21, 2022 — Update ICE Poker Rewards Split to Incentivize Upgrades and Player Ownership

All delegated NFTs followed the same reward split prior to this governance decision: the delegator would receive 30% of the rewards while the player always earned 70% of the profits. Note this system ignores NFT rank. This governance decision changes that distribution. Voters believed owners should also earn a higher percentage of the reward since they bear the full cost of upgrading the NFT. The new split for wearable delegators will be as follows:

Rank 1 — 40%; Rank 2 — 43%; Rank 3 — 46%; Rank 4 — 49%; and Rank 5 (Diamond Hands) — 52%.

Feb. 5, 2022 — Allow Partnered Metaverse Advertised in ICE Poker Venues

A decision to approve advertisements (images, video, or audio) was made by governance at the beginning of February 2022. Advertisements are to be placed in strategic but non-intrusive locations within a few of the ICE Poker venues. The first location was the Stronghold venue, followed by the implementation of advertisements in the DEXT Lounge and Chateau Satoshi as well. Payment to Decentral Games will be made through stablecoins that will fund token buyback or LP revenue.

Feb. 6, 2022 — Lower Bars to Post and Pass a Proposal

Faced with high governance participation barriers, staked tokenholders voted to lower bars to post and pass proposals. Following the approved vote, the number of xDG needed to make a proposal fell from 1.9 million xDG to 10,000 xDG, increasing the count from 33 to 185 wallets that were eligible to make proposals. The quorum to approve decisions also fell from 38 million xDG to 10 million xDG, making proposals easier to pass.

Mar. 26, 2022 — Price the Next NFT Drop in ICE Tokens Instead of ETH

Ice Poker NFT Drop #8, the one titled ICE Beach Day, was priced in ICE tokens instead of ETH as a result of this governance vote. It was the first NFT drop to do so, and NFT Drop #10 (ICE Poet) was also priced in ICE. Denominating the sale in ICE encourages minters to purchase ICE and gives the protocol the ability to recalibrate token supply. Future mints will also likely be priced in either ETH or ICE.

Roadmap

To further expand the DG ecosystem, the development team has three core priorities for the upcoming quarter: solidify in-game tokenomics, improve the gameplay of ICE Poker, and launch a mobile-first application for on-the-go accessibility.

Solidify ICE Poker Game Economics

Any successful game design relies on sustainable in-game economics. If designed poorly, games face virtual inflation, which occurs when long-time players accumulate enough in-game capital to make purchases unattainable for new players. This inflation drives new players away from the game and slows the game’s growth.

This type of inflation is a relevant concern for ICE Poker. Balancing in-game currencies, NFT sales, and new mints necessitate game faucets to ensure that the issuance and burns are well-balanced. While this is an ongoing focus area, some ideas implemented by the team are higher stakes poker competitions, non-ICE NFT wearables, and custom NFT emotes.

Scale Gameplay of ICE Poker

Having previously experimented with various games, Decentral Games found poker to be the standout hit that attracted – and retained – users. A continued goal of the Decentral Games team, therefore, is to build out features designed to improve gameplay on ICE Poker.

For example, the team shipped the Assigned Seating feature which went live on March 31. It was put in place to stop players from choosing their specific seating at an active game. Since positioning is critical for a turn-based game like poker, this new feature reduces collusion opportunities between friendly parties. The development team plans to continue adding or tweaking elements to improve its game.

Inaugurate ICE Poker Mobile

A mobile version of ICE Poker is expected to be launched in Q2 2022. The on-the-go gameplay option will allow the team to attract new users and keep existing users engaged. The Decentral Games team has explicitly called this an important milestone to “onboard the next 30,000 players into the DG ecosystem.”

Based on public announcements, it seems that ICE Poker Mobile and the browser-based metaverse will share the same in-game currency and rewards mechanisms; however, ICE Poker Mobile will be an abbreviated 2-D version of the game. The result of that decision will be shorter gameplay times, lower entry costs, and smaller in-game rewards.

Closing Summary

If the metaverse is defined by anything, it’s by a surplus of ideas and a shortage of users. Even on the user front, emerging technologies might find an old adage to hold true: attracting users is easy; retaining users is hard. When people finally choose to explore virtual worlds out of curiosity, will they continue to come back to it, day after day, week after week?

The main takeaway for Decentral Games’ Q1 is straightforward. It’s still too early to make predictions, but their current ability to draw thousands of daily active users is impressive. A big part of that may be what they’re building (poker has historically been quite successful). Yet with continued design efforts, gameplay improvements, and a mobile app launching next quarter, Decentral Games and their ICE Poker metaverse are set up for continued near-term growth.

New tools like Turbo are being built to take advantage of the Fei Protocol’s ability to mint stablecoins and manage a peg with Rari Capital’s lending platform
The FEI stablecoin showed poor adoption and performance relative to peers, but it maintained peg stability despite a volatile market.
The total addressable market for providing liquidity solutions to DAOs is in the billions of dollars and will scale with the market as a whole.

Project Overview

Initially launched in April 2021, Fei Protocol is a decentralized ERC-20 stablecoin project. The team innovated Protocol Controlled Value, using protocol-owned equity to backstop the algorithmic incentives it had created to manage a stablecoin peg. Because PCV is not debt or seigniorage, there is no risk of a liquidation event or death spiral. The risk lies in the fidelity and volatility of the PCV’s assets, relative to the outstanding liabilities in minted stablecoins. The Fei Protocol PCV consists of decentralized assets and is currently deployed to provide liquidity and earn yield. The “collateral ratio,” which measures circulating FEI supply to PCV, is a key metric in determining the credibility of the peg. Fei V2 was announced in October 2021, removing the direct incentives mechanism in favor of 1:1 redeemability of FEI for decentralized assets ETH, DAI, and LUSD. The DAO manages the reserve pools that back these mint/redeem mechanisms, currently with a 50 bps spread. As part of V2, the DAO aligned TRIBE (the project governance token) with the stablecoin as seigniorage. TRIBE now benefits from the PCV’s earnings in the form of buybacks, while also playing backstop (seigniorage) if the PCV can’t backstop the existing stablecoin supply. In January 2022, Fei Protocol merged with Rari Capital to form Tribe DAO.

Concluding Thoughts and Questions

The State of Fei

Fei is a protocol in transition — both in its utilization and structure, with the creation of Tribe DAO and merger between Fei Protocol and Rari Capital. FEI is a fully functioning stablecoin that is in its own category. Unlike most stablecoins, FEI is certainly not centralized. FEI is not a purely algorithmic stablecoin. Neither is FEI a collateralized stablecoin, as there is no debt or collateral involved. Instead, FEI can be thought of as a reserve-backed stablecoin.

The team innovated Protocol Controlled Value, which is different from collateral because it is owned and controlled by the DAO. The original design attempted to pair this PCV with an algorithmic design, using direct incentives to manage the peg with the PCV as a backstop. Despite being an innovative design and highly touted project, it did not function as desired. Fortunately, Fei was able to pivot and use 1:1 minting and redeemability of PCV for FEI within a band to maintain the peg, the design it currently uses.

Using the reserve-backed stablecoin model we can explain the balancing forces for the stablecoin peg. The reserve ratio is the ratio of total PCV relative to total FEI supplied, which includes the circulating supply and the protocol-owned supply. Intuitively, this model holds because the equity value owned by the protocol must be greater than or equal to the value that the protocol has added to the market via FEI. Empirically, it is unclear if this model will hold given the limited data, and likely needs to include an interest rate assumption for completion. In Q1, the reserve ratio dropped below 1 in January. It did correspond with downward pressure on the peg and redemptions of FEI for PCV, though the difficult market environment makes the actual causes unclear.

The reserve-backed stablecoin framework is also useful for framing Tribe DAO’s future plans. The collateral ratio (PCV relative to circulating FEI) reports how much “dry powder” the protocol has to mint and deploy FEI stablecoins productively. This is the liquidity engine that Fei Protocol created: the DAO can both earn yield on PCV assets while minting FEI against them to create and utilize protocol-owned FEI. The marriage with Rari Capital (and the New Year resolution tweet) clarifies the intentions for protocol-owned FEI: to use the lending platform and liquidity engine to become a liquidity provider for DAOs by offering cheap stablecoin liquidity to Rari lending pools. This is an extremely powerful proposition given the state of the PCV and size/growth potential of the market.

DAO treasuries are currently measured at over $9 billion. As the crypto market matures and grows so should treasuries, giving Tribe DAO the opportunity to grow into an expanding market. With the launch of Turbo in the second quarter and other future products leaked, all pitched as solutions for DAO liquidity and treasury management, the team  showing no shortage of products to utilize existing PCV to be deployed as productive protocol-owned FEI, which should increase value for the DAO.

A fundamental question going forward will be how will the DAO grow the PCV. As discussed above, Tribe DAO plans to use existing PCV to provide DAOs with liquidity. However, there is no roadmap yet for increasing demand to minting new user-owned FEI in exchange for reserve assets. The latter would require increased FEI demand and adoption. The upside, of course, is deeper, more liquid markets and greater adoption for a decentralized stablecoin. It would also mean a larger PCV. The downside is the impact on the collateral and reserve ratios. The products so far announced utilize the PCV by supplying FEI to the market with novel products that should drive returns on PCV, but they do not necessarily create incentives for FEI demand.

The teams at both Fei Labs and Rari Capital have proven to be proficient and indefatigable in their product innovation, design, and launch (i.e., the devs ship) both individually and now combined under Tribe DAO. Although the current direction of the project is becoming clear, there are still some questions and opportunities in the long term. Currently, the project is well-funded with a strong balance sheet position and new products coming to market.

The DAO Merger

On November 16, 2021, Joey Santoro (co-founder of Fei) and Jai Bhavnani (co-founder of Rari) proposed a merger of the two protocols. The final snapshot vote to tie the two was completed in January this year, forming the Tribe DAO. As of March 31, 2022, over 5.7 million RGT (Rari Governance Token), around 47% of the supply, has been exchanged for roughly 152 million TRIBE at an exchange ratio of 1:26.7. RGT holders have until August 1, 2022 at midnight GMT to exchange their tokens at the fixed rate, after which it will essentially become a meme token with no governance rights. The vote also confirmed Fei would be assuming Rari’s outstanding liabilities from a hack in 2021. Fei has paid out over $9.6 million to victims of the hack that totaled slightly over $11.6 million. Although snapshot votes passed with few voting dissent (0 RGT against, 3.9k TRIBE against), the team created a ragequit mechanism for TRIBE holders who disagreed with the decision. About 10% of these holders chose to transfer for a fixed amount of FEI (roughly 1.088/TRIBE).

The merger was motivated by the synergy team’s saw between the two protocols and fairly equal market caps. Fei has a treasure chest of liquidity via PCV, and Rari has Fuse, a platform to create customizable lending pools. FEI was already the largest asset by total value locked in Fuse pools. If their incentives were aligned under one DAO, the team would be able to take the rails of the two projects to build significantly more powerful products. The existing products, FEI stablecoin and Rari Fuse Pools and Vaults, will continue to operate independently while being governed by Tribe DAO. The focus of their new product launches is to find use cases to marry lending markets with a liquidity engine.

FEI Stablecoin Performance

The protocol’s primary product lagged behind peers in the first quarter in terms of supply growth, volumes, and velocity (the ratio of volume to supply). The V2 implementation and governance updates thereafter helped the stablecoin maintain its peg within the desired band, piggybacking off the DAI peg with a 1:1 redeemability for DAI via the peg stability mechanism. However, in terms of volatility around the peg, FEI’s peg remains wider than the top five stablecoins.

The supply numbers for FEI include both circulating FEI and protocol-owned FEI. As market volatility increased in December and January, so did DAI and FEI peg stability. This led to increased redemption of FEI for DAI, primarily from arbs. Simultaneously, PCV declined as ETH fell, putting pressure on the reserve ratio. Fei Protocol enacted contractionary monetary policies on January 23 and January 25 by reducing protocol-owned FEI from the market. For the quarter, circulating FEI supply fell 18%, and protocol-owned FEI dropped by 38%. As of March 31, 59% of FEI supply is on DEXs, led by Uniswap and Curve. Under 12% of supply is on lending platforms, with Rari and Aave the largest holders.

PCV Management

Fei’s PCV is predominantly ETH as measured by core assets (including stETH and other ETH lending deposits). It’s entering the quarter at about two-thirds concentration in the asset. Almost the entire remainder is in decentralized stablecoins LUSD, DAI, and RAI, with about a 2% balance spread across native lending and exchange tokens like BAL, COMP, AAVE, TOKE, CREAM, etc., and a 1% position in DPI. As the selloff in markets progressed through December and January, Fei saw a substantial amount of FEI redeemed in exchange for DAI, depleting balances from $125.6 million to $44.7 million by the end of the quarter. The team made monetary changes by reducing the supply of FEI to relieve pressure on the peg. Redemptions have since halted, leaving Fei Protocol with a 75% concentration in ETH as a core asset at the close of the first quarter.

The PCV shrunk in value by 12.3% in Q1. The primary factors were the circulating FEI redemptions for DAI as well as an 11% fall in ETH price, which was largely offset with a 9% increase in ETH held. The second largest increase in PCV was the introduction of gOHM to the PCV after entering into a partnership with OlympusDAO, building a $2.1 million position. The Tribe DAO controls the allocation of the PCV and was active in the quarter. The biggest changes were repurposing ETH from Compound and a second Balancer pair to Aave. Stablecoins were also released from Compound and the Liquity Stability Pool, a yield-generating pool of assets that liquidate LUSD loans, as the protocol replenished the stablecoin balance after the January Dai drain.

Tracking the PCV’s yield generation will reveal the efficacy of the DAO to manage the assets in the PCV. Unfortunately, it is difficult to track revenues produced by allocations currently. As the steward of the PCV, the DAO is incentivized to optimally allocate both PCV assets and protocol-owned FEI. This risk/reward balance should directly impact the value of the TRIBE token.

TRIBE token

With the launch of Fei V2, TRIBE became more than just a governance token. It assumed the buyer-of-last-resort role to backstop FEI as well as benefit from buybacks from earnings on PCV. Most importantly, however, TRIBE is the governance token for Tribe DAO, managing FEI, Rari Capital, and the PCV. There is an initial maximum supply of 1 billion TRIBE, with 453 million circulating at the end of the first quarter. Because the DAO has discretion to allocate rewards to incentivize liquidity, the token&#39;s inflation rate will be dynamic going forward. That said, the core team and investors are subject to a 4-year linear vesting and 5-year back-weighted vesting, respectively. The DAO uses the treasury TRIBE holdings as extra rewards to incentivize users to engage with different Fuse Pools as well as other liquidity investments with their PCV or protocol-owned FEI. To increase the alignment of governance and yield for TRIBE holders, the DAO is planning to release xTribe in Q2.

Liquidity-as-a-Service (LaaS)

In November 2021, Fei Protocol and Ondo Finance launched Liquidity-as-a-Service (LaaS). LaaS is a debt offering that DAO treasuries can use to increase their project’s liquidity. Historically, liquidity mining is at the cost of equity capital for a treasury, as they need to bootstrap two sides of a liquidity pool as well as incentivize others to do so with token rewards, i.e., equity from the treasury. With LaaS, the DAO only needs to fund one side of the liquidity pool, and FEI will loan them a stablecoin for the other side. The cost of the debt is a fixed percentage paid to Fei Protocol (5% in the first iteration) plus the impermanent loss of the pair, less trading fees earned. At the end of the loan, the DAO pays back Fei Protocol the full senior principal position plus interest, keeping the liquidity fees.

This offering still has its risks. For Fei, if the DAO token they are loaning against goes down more than 50%, the DAO will have to liquidate other treasury assets to pay back the loan in full. Because this is a debt offering, not equity, Fei might need to secure collateral to the junior assets it is loaning against in the event the borrower’s treasury doesn’t have enough assets to repay.

The first experiment resulted in both profit and risk, as seen by the bear market ensuing shortly after launch.

Results from the first experiment were profitable but also demonstrative of the nuanced risks, revealed by the bear market that ensued shortly after launch. First of all, there was a lot of appetite from DAOs, proving there is demand for this liquidity product. Fei also learned a lesson on how to approach liquidity and debt offerings. Some holes in the first iteration were no liquidation rules nor collateral controls, leaving Fei in the unintentional position of directional trader. In the coming launch of Turbo and other products, the DAO will benefit from this first Liquidity-as-a-Service innovation and will be able to create new guardrails and frameworks for deploying FEI. There are also more opportunities to launch new LaaS markets in a more structured form.

Roadmap

Turbo

Launched on April 20, Turbo is the first release from the newly formed Tribe DAO of Rari Capital and Fei Protocol. An interest-free stablecoin-lending facility to DAOs, Turbo takes whitelisted DAO treasury assets (native tokens) as collateral in exchange for a zero-interest loan on FEI, as long as the FEI is allocated to a yield-generating strategy. The appeal to DAOs is a liquidity boost to their lending pools.

For example, if ABC DAO was whitelisted (certain liquidity and historical volatility metrics need to be met) by Tribe DAO for Turbo, then ABC could borrow FEI for zero interest against an equal value of ABC collateral as long as it will add the FEI to a yield generating strategy like a Fuse pool. Adding a stablecoin to a Fuse Pool increases liquidity in the pool in two ways: first, by increasing total size, meaning more can be loaned at a lower utilization rate, and second, by adding an asset that can be borrowed using the treasury asset allocated as collateral. For ABC DAO, ABC tokenholders would be able to lend their assets to the pool and borrow FEI against that collateral. The DAO receives interest and fees on those assets — a productive use for previously stagnant treasury assets - and Tribe DAO also takes a cut of those fees, adding to its PCV.

For Tribe DAO, Turbo is a way to monetize its PCV. As discussed earlier, Tribe DAO should seek to manage FEI monetary policy and keep total FEI supplied below the PCV. However, while the reserve ratio mentioned above remains above 1, Tribe DAO can use its ability to mint FEI as a productive use of capital to generate fees, essentially borrowing against its PCV to mint and loan out FEI. This dynamic demonstrates how the liquidity engine of Fei Protocol (i.e., the ability to maintain a stablecoin and attract assets for PCV) paired with the lending platform of Fuse can create productive capital.

xTribe

The Tribe token continues to evolve along with the Tribe DAO. At inception, TRIBE was the governance token for the Fei Protocol managing the FEI peg and PCV allocations. After the transition to V2, TRIBE became a seigniorage token as well, benefiting from yield in PCV in the form of buybacks while taking on risk as the backstop for FEI.

As the Fei-Rari partnership grew, Fei voted to increase TRIBE rewards for lending TRIBE into Fuse pools, which only increased post-merger. As a result, over 10% of circulating TRIBE was locked in Fuse Pool 8 (184 million as of March 31, 2022) to optimize rewards, which inhibited those holders from participating in governance. On March 22, Joey introduced xTribe, an ERC-4626-compatible token, to align governance and yield-seeking incentives.

Existing TRIBE locked in Fuse Pool 8 and existing RGT locked in Fuse pool 6 and 7 will be automatically upgraded, while future TRIBE staked in yield-generating strategies can receive xTribe for their TRIBE. The new token will offer auto-compounding for holders, the ability to participate in governance with multi-delegation capabilities, and the ability to be used as collateral in Turbo with the largest revenue share out of any token. xTribe is expecting a code audit this April and then will be waiting on a DAO vote.

An interesting dynamic will be the rewards direction that is empowered by xTRIBE. Like the Curve Wars model where stakers get to vote on rewards direction, xTRIBE will give stakers a vote that can direct TRIBE rewards in Fuse pools. So if xTRIBE stakers want to direct more TRIBE rewards to any specific pool or asset, they could do so. From a DAO liquidity standpoint, this means users can further incentivize liquidity in their token in the lending pools by directing rewards towards it.  

Other Q1 Proposals and Changes

January 25, 2021 — Upgrade Dai Redeemability

The team discussed methods to tighten the peg given its underperformance in terms of volatility around the peg compared to other large DeFi stablecoins. The proposal was to tighten the FEI peg to DAI in the PSM. Coincident to the early January volatility and loss of DAI from the PCV via redemptions, the team decided to also remove mint fees from the DAI PSM in order to incentivize rebuilding DAI balances in the PCV. The tighter peg and incentives have helped reduce volatility around the peg and increase DAI in the PCV.

February 10, 2021 — Governance Enhancements

New governance enhancements proposed using Liquid Representative Democracy. According to Joey’s post,

“Liquid Representative Democracy means that a committee is elected by the DAO to operate the Optimistic Timelock with discretion. The DAO can at any time change the composition of the committee by adding or removing signers. This opens up more opportunities for the most committed community members to play an elevated role in governance.”

The committee will be the Tribe Council, operating a 5-of-9 multisig and made up of community, Fei core, and Rari infrastructure members. No group can individually reach a quorum. To balance the greater powers given to the Council, there will be a 4-day time lock on decisions as well as greater veto powers given to Tribe DAO (1-day time lock), Guardian (immediate execution), and Nope DAO (immediate execution). This is a novel structure using Orca Pods and optimizing for speed in the product suite with protection for the DAO as a whole. The structure will likely require greater transparency on actions and proposals for negative consent from the DAO.

March 21, 2021 — PCV Sentinel

DAO passed a vote to create the PCV Sentinel, giving the ability to create automatic guards to the DAO Guardian wallet. The Guardian wallet can pause or unpause any operations related to the PCV. A guard in the Sentinel is a smart contract capable of pausing PCV operations if a trigger is hit, empowering the team to have automatic fail safes on the PCV to protect assets.

March 24, 2021 — Volt joins the TRIBE

VOLT is a CPI-pegged stablecoin backed by a combination of user-deposited assets and PCV, incubated by Tribe DAO. With this proposal, the Tribe DAO agreed to a token swap, assuming control of 30% of VOLT and a 10 million FEI backstop for VOLT at launch. 

Conclusion

Fei Protocol and the emerging Tribe DAO are in a strong position but lacking momentum. FEI usage has declined while other stablecoins are increasing adoption. The PCV is well-backed, the liquidity engine is stable, and the lending platform is running well. New product launches should offer an exciting use case and proof of concept for the combined team. The individuals involved in the project are highly capable and have proven their ability to learn, iterate, and build. Execution and product market fit for the new launches has yet to be proven, but the building blocks are well-made and in place.

Sami Kassab - Research Analyst, Messari
Getty Hill - Co-founder, GFX Labs and Member, 2021 Compound Grants Committee

Sean Butterfield (00:07): We are live! It&#39;s official! So yeah, thanks everyone for joining us on this Compound quarterly analyst call. I just want to let everyone know, if you guys have any questions feel free to drop them and we&#39;ll try to address those towards the end of the call. Quick introduction, my name is Sean. We have Sami here, and we&#39;re both research analysts at Messari. We&#39;re here today with Getty Hill from GFX Labs. Very kind of him to be joining us here again today so thank you for that. If you want to just give a brief introduction of who you are, what&#39;s GFX Labs about and kind of how you guys fit into the puzzle of Compound.

Getty Hill (00:49): Yeah sure thing, thanks for having me here. I&#39;m glad to be invited back for a second time to go through the numbers here on Compound over the last quarter. So myself and GFX Labs have been involved in Compound now for definitely at least two years, solidly. We&#39;re responsible for a lot of the fun governance stuff in the protocol, and one of the general movers and shakers on there as well. Definitely check out the other work that we&#39;re doing in general in the space. We have Poppy, which is a neat crypto credit card product that we&#39;re developing and the game Etherlands, but we love to dabble in DeFi and governance wholeheartedly as well. So you can see our work on Compound by checking out the forum over there or on Uniswap and whatnot as well. We&#39;re in all places for the most part, we really enjoy participating in DeFi and the wild space of crypto.

Sean Butterfield (01:41): Awesome, yeah thanks for that overview. So yeah, basically the focus of this call today is really to kind of dig into some on-chain data, get a better understanding of what happened over the quarter and identify any changes in KPIs, some key changes to the protocol, and overall market trends. So, before going into that I just want to give everyone, maybe some new viewers, a quick recap of what Compound is. A leading decentralized interest rate protocol, serving as a marketplace for lenders and borrowers of various assets. Before digging into the macro, I kind of want to give a quick crypto market backdrop. Generally the overall crypto market in Q4 hit all-time highs, which largely drove a lot of the activity in the previous quarter. As we rolled into Q1 we saw some volatility, shaving $1.4 trillion off the peak back in Q4 to around $1.6 trillion in Q1. Revisiting those 12 month lows that we saw back in july of 2021. I think as we understand that a little better it&#39;ll kind of help drive and appreciate the narrative of the overall Compound sentiment over the last quarter. It appears leverage increases as the markets experience bull cycles. So, as we mentioned, the market cooled down in Q1, and that&#39;s a really good segue into going over some of these macro metrics for Compound. I&#39;m going to share my screen here so bear with me. Are we all good here? Awesome. So yeah, you&#39;ll see outstanding loans and deposits are really the driving factors of Compound. As you can see we saw a pretty substantial decrease across all indicators here. We saw about a 42% decrease in outstanding loans. Coming from about $6 billion to about $3.5 billion. Largely driven by the borrower appetite, the demand for leverage decreasing in Q1, and going down. Outstanding deposits dropped about 32% coming from $14 billion to just shy of $10 billion. Originations also took a pretty big hit, just over 50%, going from $11 billion to just under $6 billion. Subsequently, deposits also were down about 80%, a pretty nasty metric there. We saw $63 billion last quarter drop to about $13 billion and change this quarter. Really the only metrics that saw any light were liquidations, but at the same time probably not favorable for most of the users of the protocol. We saw about a 300% increase in liquidations from about $34 million to $134 million. I think that was mostly driven by the wETH markets on Compound. Digging a little deeper into the net interest, income, or the financial I should say. Total interest income was slashed by about 50% from $90 million in Q4 to just under $42 million. As the loan demand decreased, depositor demand decreased which ultimately decreased interest expense from about $80 million to about $37 million giving us just shy of $5 million on that interest income. Q1 there was a pause in the grants program so there weren&#39;t any grants paid so we really just have an unchanged net income amount of $4.8 million. Going a little further down we have the token incentives paid. Similarly as the loans outstanding and the deposits outstanding decline, we&#39;ll definitely see a decline across the token incentives being paid. So that fell from $55 million to about $26 million over the quarter. Giving us an adjusted net income improvement of about 53%, ending negative $22 million in the quarter. That was a lot of data thrown at you so I hope you were able to digest some of that. I wanted to ask you Getty, if you have any overall broad input on those changes over the quarter?

Getty Hill (07:06): Yeah, I think it definitely wasn&#39;t by any means a strong quarter for Compound. I think similar though, it was a tough one in general for many platforms in DeFi so it&#39;s not exactly Compound acting as an anomaly in this instance. I think generally speaking some of the key external inputs in the space, there are strong indicators to what the health of the ecosystem has kind of shown over the last quarter or so. Definitely slow, I mean, I noticed the other day that Tether had its last print on April 3rd and in February, late February was the last USDC mint. So things that for the most part in Q4 and certainly in Q3 were just chugging along printing huge amounts of new dollars and value into the space have substantially contracted. So I think those are interesting indicators to say okay, maybe there&#39;s some external reason behind the shrinking growth in the platform over the last quarter. I do want to highlight one of the most important line items on this page here is aggregate utilization. After all, the protocol&#39;s job is to take in assets that folks lend the protocol, and then lend assets out to borrowers and that&#39;s a key stat to me on here. It&#39;s a bit hard to say when you see outstanding loans in terms of a dollar value adjusting because there&#39;s all these coin prices and whatnot. Aggregate utilization is an important one because of that. So it&#39;s disappointing to see that it is down, but when compared to some of those other stats that are showing 41% shrink in outstanding loans, and the 32% shrink in deposits, I think it becomes a lot easier to stomach. When you understand the general bread and butter of the protocol here, sure it shrunk, but it really shrunk by less than 6% over the last quarter and that&#39;s that&#39;s the key component for me.

Sean Butterfield (09:09): Yeah great, thank you for that input. Sami did you have anything?

Sami Kassab (09:14): No, I think Getty just made a good point related to how a lot of the decreases aren&#39;t a direct relation to specifically Compound, it&#39;s mainly related to the general financial market that we&#39;re seeing going on in the crypto space. We had general market conditions trading sideways and so a lack of users looking for leverage is essentially going to lead to a lack of borrowing activity. Pretty straightforward here.

Sean Butterfield (09:50): Getty, quick question, you know I feel like these metrics are pretty easy to follow, is there anything outside of this that you typically look at and maybe does it change as the overall market sentiment changes? Whether we&#39;re in more of a bull cycle or more of a bear cycle, are there different indicators that you&#39;re keeping track of?

Getty Hill (10:13): I think there&#39;s some specific users that you can look at that demonstrate a good wind vane essentially for the flow funds in the space. If you look at some of these monster accounts, I mean especially if you want to figure out who the big users are on the platform and track what they&#39;re doing and say hey, these guys are sophisticated. They&#39;re on AAVE, they&#39;re on MakerDAO, they&#39;re on Compound, they&#39;re on all the money markets. They&#39;re even on cross-chain platforms. Where are they putting their capital? How is their capital flowing? Those users are the ones I tend to look at when we want to get a bit more of a specific sample as to what&#39;s happening. One of the reasons why Compound is what it is today is that there are a lot of users who used it once upon a time, a year ago, two years ago, and just never left. That makes it a little harder to look at the whole picture and get a macro sense of what exists here and what&#39;s actually occurring in the trend. If you look at some of those particular target users who have a few hundred million dollar position on Compound but also on AAVE and also on MakerDAO, they paint a better picture of exactly why users are flowing capital from point A to B. Is it because MakerDAO is reducing their interest rates and providing a more capital efficient opportunity for those users? Is it because AAVE is offering some new assets that have a collective better overall margin opportunity for those users? Those are the details that you can&#39;t necessarily encompass in a macro overview like this that can paint a bit more of a precise picture.

Sean Butterfield (11:48): Yeah I totally agree with that comment, and yeah we might high level touch on something similar to what you&#39;re saying as it relates to the more sophisticated deeper liquidity folks who are participating on the platform. So, moving along, Sami, I&#39;ll let you take over here. We&#39;re going to go over some of the charts as it relates to these outstanding loans and deposits and I&#39;ll let you take care of that Sami.

Sami Kassab (12:24): I appreciate that. So, starting off here with the outstanding loans. In general we saw outstanding loans declined by roughly 42% like Sean was saying. These levels are going back to what we saw around July of 2021 and again like we discussed, this is mainly related to market conditions trading very choppy for the past quarter. We really haven&#39;t seen any new highs like we saw in Q4. Just a lot of volatility up and down which is what you see in a sideways trading market. The biggest contributors that we have to outstanding loans are obviously the stable coins and that&#39;s where we saw the biggest decrease. We had DAI which decreased roughly 47% this quarter and USDC decreased roughly 41% this quarter as far as outstanding loans. Now, if we go to the next chart here we can take a look at the borrower interest rates. In general, last quarter these rates were averaging at about 5% in Q4. For this quarter, Q1, we saw rates averaging about 3.8%. A pretty substantial drop in borrower interest rates. One thing I found that was interesting is ever since Q3 you&#39;re kind of seeing a minimization of volatility in general for borrower interest rates and that&#39;s kind of excluding what we saw in October and November of 2021. We saw the volatility there take up mainly around when the market was peaking as far as the general market cap. One thing I wanted to ask you about Getty, the majority of borrowing demand on Compound we know is originating from people looking for leverage and also people seeking out yield farming opportunities. That&#39;s really because DeFi in its state right now is more of a circular economy. It doesn&#39;t really feed into too many real world applications. I was curious if you had any views on where you saw future new demand, new borrowing demand, originating from? Do you have any thoughts on that?

Getty Hill (15:01): Yeah, I think in the immediate future there are a number of collateral assets the platform is looking to support and I think those will be the most immediate things to drive our demand. Particularly something that GFX Labs has been working on is getting MATIC added to the platform, Polygon’s native currency. I think there&#39;s a huge amount of interest in getting that supported and on somewhere on mainnet because currently it&#39;s not actually available to borrow against anywhere on mainnet, in size at least. I think that&#39;s on the immediate forefront, and then from there I think the longer term view looks like the industry is still extremely nascent in the whole sense. I don&#39;t think necessarily external motives from the traditional world are going to be influencing the platform anytime soon. I do think as we look to expand beyond basic ERC-20  tokens as collateral and some more sophisticated positions, new opportunities will rise to the platform. People have been talking about getting stETH added to the platform which has been quite popular. Other versions of staked ETH also, and then from there other derivatives like some of these AMM LP tokens and whatnot that you can safely assign collateral values to. It&#39;s a matter of time, and building out the infrastructure for those components, but I think that&#39;s what will be drawing borrowers in over the long-term.

Sami Kassab (16:18): Yeah, that makes sense. Then when we think longer term as well, once Compound goes multi-chain that&#39;ll definitely bring new borrowing activity as well onto the protocol.

Getty Hill (16:31): Yeah absolutely, those new chains will be really important. It’s something that AAVE has done massively well on is succeeding in onboarding new assets on those chains and it’s something we have to play catch up on at this point.

Sami Kassab (16:46): Yeah so another question I wanted to bounce your way is related to recursive borrowing. For the viewers here that don&#39;t know what that is, can you kind of give an overview of what recursive borrowing is and then also provide your view on whether that has a positive impact on the protocol or if it&#39;s more of a negative or frowned upon impact?

Getty Hill (17:10): Sure thing. So there&#39;s two particular users on Compound right. There are users who supply capital because they&#39;re interested in borrowing some other assets. So they supply one coin and borrow a different coin. Then there are the other users who just supply capital to the protocol in an interest to earn yield. Now within those there&#39;s a sub category of users who just traditionally supply whatever given asset to the protocol, and then there are these recursive participants. So some just supply, some put on this bit more sophisticated strategy where you will borrow, or you do this positive collateral. Say DAI for example here, you have 100,000 DAI. Then you can go and borrow up to your maximum whatever the collateral factor is against DAI on the market and borrow the maximum of it. You now take everything you just borrowed, you deposit it back into the protocol, and you repeat this process over and again to get that recursiveness. Essentially, what it does is it amplifies your dollar notional position on the platform while maintaining the same amount of capital that you&#39;re invested into the position. Why people do this is because at times we&#39;re incentivizing participation in the protocol through COMP rewards. COMP is getting paid to the pro rata share of participants on the supply side and then the pro rata participation on the borrower&#39;s side. So users can amplify their pro rata participation in this pool by doing this recursive kind of setup here. I think that&#39;s the quick overview of what it is. This has been going on for coming up on two years, you know? But yeah, it&#39;s been going on for a long time. There has been some recent debate about how sustainable? How important are these for the platform? What do they actually mean for the platform? All that is happening here from a purely stats standpoint is the user is depositing capital and the interest rates will largely remain unchanged and the utilization of the protocol remains unchanged. Regardless of if this user is a traditional supplier of the protocol and just lending that capital, or recursively borrowing it. The amount of capital getting deposited is the same and it doesn&#39;t affect the change in utilization because they&#39;re just perfectly looping it through. So, in general the only change in the protocol is changing TVL a little bit, changing interest rates a little bit. It doesn&#39;t really provide significant capital to the protocol by any means beyond just a general supply. Essentially these things function identical to what a normal lender would do to the protocol, the only difference is that they&#39;re amplifying these stats because there are some other reasons to make the stats bigger. But for the most part they just function like any other loan to the protocol.

Sean Butterfield (19:58): Gotcha, so it sounds like it&#39;s not adding any additional risk to the protocol and so essentially they&#39;re just farming out these COMP rewards. If we ended up seeing in the future at some point these COMP rewards being removed from the market would you essentially see these recursive borrowers leave as well?

Getty Hill (20:22): I don&#39;t think they would necessarily leave, but I definitely think there would be a decrease. Essentially what&#39;s happening right now is the protocol is subsidizing rates. Just to make up a number, if the protocol is paying out 3% interest rates and the COMP rewards add an additional 25 or 50 bps to the protocol, hey that&#39;s 25 or 50 bps. In theory if we pull those out then some capital should drift away from the protocol to better opportunities. But the core premise that folks need to remember is that these guys are looping because they&#39;re interested in getting the best interest rate available. Their job is to make money ultimately and so if we decrease our rates further by removing this extra incentive but we remain to be the best option for their capital, their capital will stay. So I don&#39;t think we would lose 100%  of capital that&#39;s relying on these rates because at the same time, the general problem exists at AAVE as well and at any of their alternatives to where they can stick their capital. At this point the rates have been on a solid trend down since the very day they started, but particularly in the last half a year or so. You could look back to even five or six months ago, or at the very beginning of the year. You could still earn 12% doing a recursive loan on DAI which most viewed to be a very safe, stable rate to be earning capital and today it&#39;s substantially less than that. I think we&#39;ve already seen a solid progression of those rewards decreasing and of that participation decreasing along with it.

Sami Kassab (21:56): Perfect, I really appreciate you breaking that down. So let&#39;s go ahead and move on to the next slide where we&#39;ll talk a little bit about outstanding deposits in general. Wrapped Ethereum continues to maintain its dominance, it&#39;s the largest deposited asset on the protocol. This quarter we saw DAI and USDC kind of neck and neck competing for that second largest deposit, they&#39;re very close as far as actual dollar amounts. The interesting thing is that we saw DAI’s outstanding deposits decreased nearly 50% and then if we look at deposit volume for DAI in the quarter that was down 90%. Sean was actually pretty curious about why this DAI deposit volume had decreased so much, so he worked with one of our data scientists here and they were looking at the on-chain metrics and it was suggesting mainly that there were a few market makers that were basically arbitraging between AAVE and Compound. Like you said, looking for the best interest rates. It seems like they closed out some pretty large positions in Q1 and that goes back to what you were saying in the beginning. Looking at the macro doesn&#39;t really tell you the whole story. Looking at some of these whales and some of these users of the protocol also gives you additional insight for what&#39;s going on on the protocol. One thing that got me curious as well, last quarter we saw Coinbase’s DeFi yield integration. Essentially, if you had DAI they would pay you an interest rate and they were taking that DAI and then inserting into Compound. Last quarter we saw a large inflow of DAI and it seems that this quarter we saw a 50% reduction so it makes me think did we get a little bump in outstanding deposits from that integration that long-term wasn&#39;t really sustainable, it just depleted slowly. It makes me think because the protocol has MakerDAO’s direct deposit module coming up which is essentially going to do something similar. So, I just kind of wanted to get your view on, do you think these integrations with different products have a long-term effect on the protocol? Or is it sometimes short-term?

Getty Hill (24:32): Yeah I think it&#39;s tough to say. We don&#39;t really have a long history or really any history of protocol integrations materially changing the landscape of what the platform looks like. I&#39;m really excited for the D3M module though, MakerDAO’s direct to buy deposit module, to come about. I think that&#39;s a really efficient way for the protocol to get capital and also to symbiotically work with MakerDAO in an uncompetitive environment where everyone wins. So I&#39;m very much looking forward to that. I do think that though it&#39;s a bit hard to say what it all looks like. There&#39;s a strict balance in my mind as a bit more of a traditional DeFi person, that protocol integrations are great as long as you don&#39;t add on too much systemic risk to the space. Because ultimately some of the games that folks are playing with Compound and say well, Compound is in a great position to succeed if AAVE explodes one day, god forbid it ever happens and vice versa. So everyone needs to make sure we also don&#39;t stack on too much systemic risk in the space which could lead to the demise if something truly awful were to happen.

Sami Kassab (25:40): Moving on to depositor interest rates, in general we saw rates decrease as borrowing demand declined over the last quarter. Q4 we had the average rate for depositing be around 2%, this quarter it’s around 1.5% on average. One thing interesting to note is that we are seeing the normal depositor interest rate, and the depositor interest rate with incentives, start to converge. Not only for depositing, but for borrowers. This is partially attributed to COMP basically halving COMP rewards, and I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll talk about that quite a bit in later on, so I&#39;ll just kind of mention that for now. But, related to all these new integrations I have another question for you. Do you see the source, the main source of deposits on Compound in the future coming from professional liquidity providers? Whether it&#39;s funds, VCs, institutions, is that what the protocol is targeting rather than the normal DeFi user? This might be a general DeFi question, are these protocols starting to focus more on institutions that have more deep liquidity rather than the person who&#39;s yield farming in their mom&#39;s basement?

Getty Hill (27:19): I think we need to keep in mind when we&#39;re talking about depositor rates, we&#39;re largely thinking about the stable coins on the protocol. DAI, USDC, Tether, and I think largely speaking, the folks who are leaning on those markets the most, representing the largest portion of those markets, are institutional players or players with extreme high net worths who are looking to park dollars for safe steady rates for a long period of time. I know for certain that some of the larger participants in the borrow/lend ecosystem in crypto, like the BlockFis, the Celsius, or the Nexos of the space, certainly look at general dollar rates. The primary stack historically in crypto for dollar rates has been the funding on the Bitcoin perp. But certainly DeFi dollar rates are creeping into the methodology as well as like hey, how much do my dollars earn and where can I put them? We&#39;re slowly developing a bit of our own DeFi based LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate) across all the ecosystems.

Sami Kassab (28:23): Yeah that makes sense. Thanks for breaking that down. Last slide I&#39;ll be covering right now is going to be the utilization ratio. If we can go to that slide, Sean? This slide basically summarizes what we&#39;ve been saying. Basically the outstanding borrows have decreased in relation to outstanding deposits. The only interesting thing I can comment about this is that historically we&#39;ve seen 40% almost serve as sort of a support level and we haven&#39;t seen that rate drop below 40% for a significant period of time. But Q1 we have seen it fall below 40% for an extended period of time. I think that pretty much wraps it up here, I&#39;ll pass it back to you, Sean, to take over the next few slides.

Sean Butterfield (29:35): Cool, thank you. So we kind of touched base on this a little bit earlier in that macro table as it relates to interest income. Obviously as you can see there&#39;s a substantial decrease quarter over quarter. I think it was about a 53% decline from $90 million to $42 million in interest. It&#39;s directly correlated with the overall demand for loans, repayment on those loans, interest that essentially flows through the protocol. One thing I wanted to mention is looking at the data, it looks like USDC actually led the way in the deterioration and interest income. It accounts for about 62% decline with USDT and wBTC fighting for second in interest income deterioration with 50.8% and 50.7% respectively. Moving on to protocol income, the narrative is very much the same across the board outside of liquidations. Protocol income, same thing, was halved in Q1 a little over 50% and the same thing, USDC led that reduction in income. I&#39;d be curious Getty, I know there have been previous conversations related to improvement in protocol income. How important is it to the overall Compound protocol and community at large? Instead of me talking about some of these points I&#39;d be interested in hearing some high level remarks about what could contribute to the improvement of protocol revenue, and maybe how far we might be away from some of those implementations?

Getty Hill (31:32): Yeah so I think I&#39;ll preface it with let&#39;s keep in mind Compound’s governance has been around for less than a year and a half at this point so everyone&#39;s still learning what’s the best way to organize and everything. That being said, the reserve factor is what determines how much the protocol takes from interest paid by borrowers before it reaches the lenders. That number is a set parameter on every single market on the platform. Generally speaking, stable coins have a much lower one, altcoins have a much higher one. Particularly when we&#39;re talking about the big income earners for the protocol we&#39;re thinking about DAI, USDC, Tether. Now, USDC and Tether both have a 7% reserve factor which means we get 7% of interest paid from the borrowers there. Whereas DAI notably has 15% which means, I think the thought was this thing&#39;s a bit more volatile so we&#39;ll take a bit more when it was originally set. That being said, back to my original governance comment here, the protocol hasn&#39;t really done much to play around with these or do any type of research really about should we be choosing a higher or lower number and so we have rather limited data to actually say what we should be doing. The protocol needs to get in a spot where we&#39;re willing to experiment a bit more with those rates to actually understand how income can be optimized for the protocol and take those revenues to something a bit more sustainable than what we&#39;re currently at today. So it&#39;s a bit of a complex problem that generally needs a bit more time and testing before we really speak to it. Hopefully that&#39;s something we get to start doing here in the near future.

Sean Butterfield (33:13): Sure, recently I was scouring the forums and it looks like there&#39;s been mention of building out an asset onboarding framework as it relates to why we should onboard a specific asset. I understand demand would be a very critical factor in that but maybe if you can kind of touch base on any input you might have on that and how you think that would move forward?

Getty Hill (31:32): Yeah, that&#39;s a bit of a long point so I&#39;ll try to keep it brief here so that I don’t brick the rest of the deck here that I know we have. But you know, when it comes to listing assets you really have to think about it in a few different categories, or at least the few different points you need to assess. One is the general interest from folks who would be supplying that as collateral and folks interested in actually borrowing this collateral. One of those two things needs to be substantially true for the protocol to even really assess it. From there it becomes the security risk and understanding that. A lot of the assets that folks are interested in adding to the platform right now, other than MATIC, are FRAX, LUSD and RAI which generally speaking are a bit outside the normal range of where the protocol operates. Especially in part of the complexity and risk spectrum when it comes to asset listings. So it&#39;s a delicate balance of we want to add things to the protocol that users are interested in and want, but we don&#39;t want to stack on too much protocol risk. Because, not to be dramatic, but if we list an asset and we give it a collateral factor and it has some type of error in it, the classic example is the infamint, then all the funds in the protocol can be drained if that thing has like infinite, you know has any collateral factor greater than zero. So, the protocol tends to be quite conservative with listing new assets especially because when you look at the stats as we are here, wBTC, ETH, DAI, USDC, the protocol would be not too different if we didn&#39;t have any of these other assets in the protocol and we wouldn&#39;t be going through this spreadsheet if you just imagine we only have those four coins. It would be largely the same stuff to be talking about so you really have to be careful about the marginal improvement by adding a new asset.

Sean Butterfield (35:30): Yeah, that&#39;s great. Sami, I don&#39;t know if you had any questions or input on that?

Sami Kassab (35:38): I just think that&#39;s a great point that&#39;s getting made. It&#39;s really just stables that have the majority of borrowing demand and it kind of goes back to the multi-chain approach that is being talked about. Just having one collateral asset or one deposit asset I believe which is just going to be USDC, right? We&#39;ll be talking more about that multi-chain approach as we get towards the end of this slide deck.

Sean Butterfield (36:09): So yeah, I&#39;ll pass it back to you Sami as it relates to liquidations.

Sami Kassab (36:15): Yeah, so like you pointed out Sean, in the beginning. Liquidations was one of the only metrics that kind of had a good quarter. We saw a substantial increase in liquidations. Question to toss your way Getty, can you give some thoughts on liquidation revenues importance to the protocol? Do we see this as healthy revenue?

Getty Hill (36:38): I think this is a newer thing, so it&#39;s not recent but I think in mid-2021 we changed the liquidation system to split part of the liquidator incentive. So historically there&#39;s been about 7% or 8% that was distributed to the liquidator and then the protocol was like we&#39;re going to keep three of that for ourselves and we&#39;re going to give five of that to the liquidator. Now this is something similar to what MakerDAO does. They get some revenue from liquidations as well as I believe AAVE, but I could be wrong on that one. So you know it&#39;s a weird one, my personal opinion is that protocols shouldn&#39;t be incentivized to have liquidations. The inverse of that opinion to play devil&#39;s advocate quickly, is just simply that well the protocol is taking out risk here you should be similarly compensated for that loan. My opinion is that risk comes in the factor of the interest rate and that reserve factor we were talking about before. But yeah, I think it&#39;s a good thing to be experimenting with especially we all have to remember, as I get stuck in the trenches of DeFi quite often, that really we&#39;ve only been around for two years so there&#39;s a lot to be learned and experimented with.

Sami Kassab (37:49): Yeah, exactly. So, moving on to the next slide here we&#39;re going to have a chart on token incentives paid. I guess this is where we can talk a little bit about some of these governance proposals that have been passed. So, one of the most critical or major governance proposals that we saw passed this quarter was proposal 92, which basically reduced COMP rewards paid out by 50%. This seemed to be a pretty heated discussion as far as in the forums. There seemed to be people on both sides and I guess the plan was to kind of slowly step down to zero rewards. I think proposal 100 aimed to do that but recently, I believe two days ago, we saw proposal 100 fail. So, what is the plan? I know the community has to really talk about this but as of right now we&#39;re just kind of sitting at 50% rewards, right? Is there a plan that the community is talking about? Is there a reason why this first proposal went through and now all of a sudden it seems like the community might have changed their mind? Because I believe it was outlined how initially you guys were going to step down to 50% and then eventually to zero. So can you talk a little bit through maybe both sides of the argument related to removing rewards versus keeping them?

Getty Hill (39:39): So, first I want to set the stage a bit and say when we think about rewards and how they&#39;re distributed to users of the protocol we need to think about them in token terms and in dollar terms. Now ultimately we&#39;re assuming that the folks who are interested in these rewards the most are here for the financial incentives, that these guys are running and interested in money. So ultimately for their experience, all they care about is the dollar notional value of these tokens that are coming to them. From the protocols perspective, we probably care about the dollar notional value of those tokens but we also care about the general number of tokens as we&#39;re essentially entering new tokens into the supply, the circulating supply, and diluting all the existing COMP holders. So it&#39;s a bit of a difference there that I want to highlight. If we look over the last year or so, certainly in the last eight months, as COMP prices declined with generally the rest of the DeFi ecosystem. Those dollar notional rewards or distributed users have kind of declined itself. From the people who are interested in using the protocol&#39;s perspective rewards have already been cut, right? The inverse of that would be for us to maintain a dollar value and increase the notional amount of COMP we&#39;re distributing to maintain the actual dollar notional rewards that they&#39;re achieving, but that&#39;s not the case. So from their perspective, hey these things have already been going down for a while and you know, that&#39;s what they&#39;re used to and we already have a lot of data to support what those users are going to be doing as those rates decrease across not only Compound, but the blanket of DeFi. Now particularly with the most recent and 92 and 100 proposals, I think everyone is on the same page that these rewards aren&#39;t sustainable for the most part. I shouldn&#39;t say everyone but there&#39;s certainly some agreement around that these aren&#39;t sustainable. Things need to be reformed, and I think that&#39;s why 92 is a bit more easy to stomach. It was just a general, we&#39;re going to cut these in half. It was quite clearly cited in 92 that there was going to be a proposal 100 that was going to cut them to zero. I think folks largely either didn&#39;t read that or were just like, all right well we&#39;ll deal with that problem when we get to it. So 92 was rather not controversial. For the most part folks kind of just voted and supported it, it seemed pretty straightforward. The folks who I think represent the protocol most, happily understand that it was a good decision. Then 100 ended up being extremely controversial. I mean I haven&#39;t gone through the data because there are a hundred proposals at this point to go through, but I think it is the most controversial governance proposal that has occured on Compound, and certainly one of the most controversial ones in DeFi in general. In the sense that we had, for our protocol, very good voter turnout, about half a million on each side and it came down to 7,000 votes. Which really when you go down the list of people who are set up to vote in the protocol it was a pretty good population of folks who actually turned out to vote. There&#39;s a number of people who I was disappointed not to see but it was relatively good. Disappointing outcome from my perspective because I really think rewards at this point are doing very little to support the system and largely just hurting existing COMP holders like myself, but you know that&#39;s that&#39;s the plight of governance.

Sami Kassab (42:55): Yeah, I think it&#39;s really interesting how basically depending on how you interact with the protocol leads to how you would view this decision, right? So if you&#39;re a big whale that would be using this protocol, obviously it&#39;s not in your incentives to want some of these rewards to be removed. But, if you are a VC, or a contributor, or just simply a holder, it&#39;s in your best interest to have these rewards eventually go to zero. Because you&#39;re not getting crowded out anymore, you&#39;re not getting devalued essentially. So it&#39;s really interesting to see everybody in the community put their opinion in like you said. I mean the forum post was just popping with everybody, I think it was the one i&#39;ve seen with the most comments. Like you said, that 7,000 vote delta was extremely close. Anything to add to that, Sean?

Sean Butterfield (44:03): Not a whole lot, but as an observer, I&#39;m not a participant of the protocol, it makes a lot of sense from a sustainability point of view. Plenty of mercenary capital that&#39;s soaking up all the rewards, dumping the tokens, applying sell side pressure on the COMP token price. It makes sense that this isn&#39;t sustainable long-term and making those steps, strategic steps, to try to keep everyone on the same page, keep everyone happy, but also maintain the health of the protocol. Definitely in agreement with the conversation there.

Getty Hill (44:44): I&#39;ll add a quick tidbit there, so while this proposal was going on, I was doing some quick research to figure out how many of these COMP rewards are roughly going to folks who are just immediately selling the token. What are these recursive participants doing? Because generally those are the folks who are doing it, and what are they immediately doing et cetera. If you just look at the top 10 suppliers of USDC to the protocol, the top 10 suppliers of DAI to the protocol, and you only look at those accounts. DAI and USDC alone account for over 77% of total COMP rewards distributed in the program. So largely those two alone account for pretty much everything. Then from there you can look at these users and see what their activity is and what they&#39;re doing. You&#39;re going to count right there between all of them that they represent these recursive users who are just here simply with mercenary capital, which is fine, I&#39;m totally fine with that. They get the COMP, and then just immediately sell the COMP. That accounts for about 41% of the COMP rewards getting distributed and that&#39;s just the sample of the top 10 users on those two markets alone. I was trying to get some quick data in like 30 minutes together and that&#39;s what I quickly found. I was like well if it&#39;s 41% with just this set, the number is definitely a fair bit higher. All we&#39;re getting out of this is a little more capital in the protocol and a higher TVL number and you know, for what? To continue diluting all the existing holders and accepting kind of mediocrity on this program. To me it&#39;s a pretty black and white issue that I did not expect to be so controversial in proposal 100.

Sean Butterfield (46:29): Yeah, you bring up a lot of good points and it&#39;s not that we don&#39;t want participants on Compound but we also need to kind of create a healthy floor and stabilize the overall protocol so kind of shaking out some of the mercenary capital by removing some of those incentives makes sense.

Getty Hill (46:51): Yeah I mean we have a great user base. You guys have the data here to show that there is billions of dollars of regular, natural usage of the protocol. Folks who are supplying ETH and wrapped Bitcoin, and borrowing dollars for the core example of leverage on their assets. This program that we have here to distribute incentives, best case is adding like $1.5 billion, really best case is adding $1.5 billion. Most likely it’s adding somewhere between about $650 million, $800 million to the protocol. It&#39;s not significant to the actual day-to-day operations of the protocol or fundamentally changing anything about the protocol. It&#39;s really just in my mind a leach on the protocol at this point. Compound existed well before the COMP incentives ever existed and proved that it had a natural use case in the market, and the data still supports that it does today. So can we get rid of this thing already please?

Sean Butterfield (47:50): That makes a lot of sense. As I said, as an observer just looking at it really from a data perspective, hearing input from the community and yourself. Overall, you just want an attractive protocol that&#39;s sustainable, that&#39;s healthy, that promotes growth, and encourages users. So it’s a step in the right direction and I&#39;ll be curious to see how the next proposal that might try to bring the emissions down to zero will go. As we move forward, we touched on deposit volume a little bit. An 80% decline over the quarter, from $63 million to $13 million in deposits. DAI accounted for a lot of that and as Sami was mentioning, me and another couple folks were digging into some on-chain data and it looks like it&#39;s exclusive to a few market makers that were really trying to arbitrage between AAVE and Compound early or sometime in Q4. Not only is it super cool to see the on-chain data to kind of make those suggestions but it&#39;s also interesting to see that&#39;s really what drove a lot of quarterly deposit volume. Then also as we enter Q1 it looks like maybe a separate market maker was basically redeeming their funds from the protocol. Maybe in preparation for the reduction of COMP emissions towards the end of Q1. So yeah, really interesting to see as you look at the chart, it&#39;s a pretty glaring drop in quarterly volume. As we kind of wrap up here, at least as relates to charts, originations, same story. Demand for loans declined. The demand for new loans will follow. So seeing a 53% drop from $11 billion to $5 billion. What I thought was interesting is four consecutive quarters of the declining originations. I think that&#39;s largely related to the overall market sentiment but we might be curious if you have any kind of input or future outlook of originations moving forward.

Getty Hill (50:25): You know, stats like volume and originations are a bit hard to nail down. Just because it&#39;s DeFi, capital is just extremely liquid. If folks want to leave and join the protocol for an instant they are welcome to do so with no penalty. So that makes these stats kind of hard to focus on and that goes back to the very first slide. The thing to really care about is that utilization number. So for me that&#39;s the number I focus on. Less so the originations and volume stats.

Sean Butterfield (50:56): That makes perfect sense to me. I mean like you said, you could easily throw a billion in and take a billion out inside of a day and it still contributes to originations or deposit volume on a quarterly basis. So that makes a lot of sense. So yeah, moving on into governance. It looks like there&#39;s about eight proposals that were passed in the quarter. I won&#39;t touch base on all of them, but I&#39;d say there were a few that were pretty critical changes to the protocol. Sami, did you want to take a stab at those?

Sami Kassab (51:37): Yeah, so we talked about two of the really important ones, proposal 92 and proposal 100. I guess one of the other ones I found interesting was proposal 89 and that was reducing the proposal threshold from 65k COMP to 25k COMP. Which I think is important to stimulate further activity into the governance system. One thing I thought that was interesting was that we really didn&#39;t see that many voters on proposal 100, even though it might have been one of the more popular propositions or governance proposals. I think there were a total of 48 addresses. So Getty personally, have you seen that trying to get people to contribute to some of these governance proposals has been difficult?

Getty Hill (52:37): You know, it&#39;s not so much the number for me as it is the amount of COMP that shows up to vote. These systems aren&#39;t democracies you know, we run on a plutocracy system here where it&#39;s based off of capital rather than who&#39;s present. So for me, it&#39;s what’s the COMP turn out in these things? The COMP turnout was decent, it was pretty on par with the other significant proposals that we&#39;ve had historically. It certainly could have been higher, I would have liked to see a number of folks turn out that didn&#39;t turn out. But I think for the most part it wasn&#39;t disappointing as a specific proposal. In general it&#39;d be nice to see that we had a larger percentage of the COMP turnout to vote. As you know we&#39;re 6 million circulating supply, 6.5 million circulating supply. To only have a million turnout isn&#39;t terrible, but it isn&#39;t great either. It&#39;d be nice to have two million turnout for these things as far as the number of voters goes. If you just check out on the Compound website there&#39;s great databases for this stuff. Really, once you get around to voter 50 as far as the leaderboard goes, the amount of votes really substantially drops off. A lot of these things are largely decided amongst the top 25 people, just because that&#39;s where the power is really contained as far as the number of votes, and who possesses those votes.

Sami Kassab (54:01): Yeah, any thoughts on potentially, I don&#39;t know if any protocols actually do this, but incentivizing people to contribute to, or just to vote in general?

Getty Hill (54:16): I don&#39;t think that active voting is really important. That&#39;s kind of the weird part of this. So there should be more things to vote on in general. I think that&#39;s important, that&#39;s one of the reasons why I like the idea of 89 and that there&#39;s about three facets of making proposals right now. You either have enough votes delegated to you that you can make the proposal, or you either have the COMP yourself, and you know the total number of coins. Or you&#39;re on the white list. Essentially a thing that the community multisig in governance controls is the whitelist addresses with proposal power. The whitelist is neat but that&#39;s largely a social mechanism and so the first two are still the most critical ones for the protocol. You cannot call yourself a true DeFi protocol that has governance unless you have completely on-chain control of all the code and all the contracts that make up that system and make it accessible for anyone to come and change something about that system without asking anyone else for permission. That is to me, the core tenant here. So lowering the proposal threshold from 65 thousand to 25 thousand materially doesn&#39;t change the risk of the system, the quorum, the number of votes required to actually get a proposal to succeed, is remaining the same. Folks could actually argue to raise that number as well but the system should be more accessible to a larger populace to make those proposals. Not everyone is as fortunate as me. While I have a large percentage of my net worth in Compound, I don&#39;t actually have the 75 thousand votes that we have on the platform. We&#39;re lucky enough to have some folks who have those tokens that are willing to delegate to us since we pay a lot of attention to the protocol.

Sami Kassab (55:58): Gotcha, yes, proposal 89 really just increased decentralization and inclusivity of the protocol. So for the sake of time, I guess we&#39;ll speed through this next slide here just on grants. Is there a date yet related to when the new grant program will be back?

Getty Hill (56:20): No, I mean I think it&#39;s a matter of a personnel problem. Essentially you just need someone to come in and run it. That person, if someone&#39;s listening here, listening to this recording is interested in trying to run a grants program for a protocol and might have some experience applicable to it. Do come to the forum, write a forum post, make your argument that you should do it. You can get paid quite handsomely to do this, this is by no means a side gig. Uniswap employs a team for their grants program and so do other protocols, and they all get paid quite handsomely. So I think it&#39;s really just a personal problem at this point. Everyone&#39;s for it but no one has the time or the bandwidth for the compensation that&#39;s being discussed.

Sean Butterfield (57:00): Yeah, just a couple last points as it relates to the road map a little bit. If you could maybe share some details on where we&#39;re at as it relates to the multi-chain strategy and then lastly, I know there are some limited details as well around Compound 3, but maybe if you could share what you can, what you know, and your general outlook on both of those.

Getty Hill (57:30): Yeah, absolutely. So, I don&#39;t have any proprietary information. I&#39;ll say that first, I&#39;m just for all intents and purposes, a community member and I know for a fact that really largely all the VCs are in the same boat. The Labs team, who&#39;s the core engineers behind the protocol, does a very good job of not telling anyone anything. So what we do know is really just the public information. So they&#39;ve done two developer calls in recent times where they have discussed Compound 3 with folks. Generally it&#39;s a much slimmed down version of the protocol. Instead of the generalized money market right now where folks can deposit and borrow anything on either end, you&#39;re supplying a thing as collateral and you&#39;re only borrowing USDC or whatever that reserve asset is. So the first version as they&#39;ve told everyone is going to be with USDC as the reserve asset. In theory that reserve asset could be anything else, which makes the system a bit interesting. You could have a bunch of little versions of Compound 3 like little silos where you could have one that&#39;s flavored to ETH where you&#39;re depositing a bunch of ETH derivatives and only borrowing ETH as the reserve. You could be depositing a bunch of Bitcoin derivatives and buying only wrapped Bitcoin as the reserve. All sorts of fun things could be done with this and I think that&#39;s kind of where they&#39;re going with it. A bit more of a gas efficient, simpler protocol to swallow and just generally more efficient. Like all the original smart contracts at this point are well over I think two years, and so that&#39;s the other main component here. Making it easier to deploy and run on the other chains. So frankly though we don&#39;t have tons of information as far as timeline goes in development, we know what they&#39;ve stated is that there is the plan to post the open source version of the protocol in late April. So maybe this week, maybe next week, I&#39;m not holding my breath. Maybe a couple weeks after that and then we&#39;ll get a testnet version of it the following month. The code is going to go to audit to Open Zeppelin and Open Zeppelin is the formal audit partner of the protocol so I think they&#39;re putting on the finishes with that and it&#39;s going to be going to Open Zeppelin here in the next few weeks, so I&#39;ve heard through the grapevine. Then we&#39;ll kind of go from there. I mean, I think everyone&#39;s kind of hoping for a mainnet launch in July or something, or June. But everyone keep a massive grain of salt with everything I said because this is coming through about like 30 minutes worth of two different conversations, and everything is subject to change and I don&#39;t know anything really in reality. So, we&#39;ll see what comes. I think everyone&#39;s excited.

Sean Butterfield (01:00:06): Yeah, that sounds great. I was able to catch some of those calls and it does sound like the testnet is supposed to kick off shortly so I&#39;m sure everyone&#39;s pretty excited about that. Real quick, it seems like the development&#39;s been a little different as it relates to the multi-chain strategy. I know the initial idea was to kind of go with that Starport integration and it seems like there were some development hiccups. As the landscape developed over DeFi and multi-chain strategies compromised platforms. It sounds like they were kind of trying to pivot to a different model? Are you able to maybe touch on that a little bit?

Getty Hill (01:00:50): Yeah, I don&#39;t know much. I think the general idea was let&#39;s make the code simple and let&#39;s make it easy to deploy and easy to manage. There have been hints at additional tools to help manage all these different employments and some new testing tools throughout these protocols. It&#39;s been discussed that the new oracle solution that the protocol is going to go with is just going to be directly Chainlink. Which is advantageous for all the different chain deployments where there isn&#39;t necessarily robust on-chain liquidity that exists on Ethereum. But I mean largely we don&#39;t know. Again there&#39;s a lot of guessing work going on right now so I think we&#39;ll find out in the next few weeks here a lot more information. Then you even still have the product the next couple of months and it should be a fun summer.

Sean Butterfield (01:01:39): Yeah, sounds good, something to look forward to. I don&#39;t know if Sami, if you had any other questions on our end? You know we&#39;re pretty much rounding the hour here so I think the questions from the community have been submitted and I think we&#39;ve kind of touched base on that. If any other viewers have any questions please feel free to throw them down, otherwise it&#39;s been a good time. I&#39;ve really enjoyed having you and hearing all your insight.

Getty Hill (01:02:24): For folks who are interested in following along with Compound in general there&#39;s the forum at compound.xyz. There&#39;s the governance action forum on Compound Finance, you can check out the proposals that exist there. Join the Discord as well. There&#39;s a developer call that exists every Wednesday in the morning, well every other Wednesday. Then on the other Wednesdays that aren&#39;t the Compound lab developer call I tend to run a community call on Twitter that&#39;s a bit more casual than the formal developer call. In general for folks who are interested in following GFX Labs and our interesting governance on Uniswap, MakerDAO, and Compound, and the other awesome products that we&#39;re developing over here. Which is in fact, what really I spend most of my time on, believe it or not. Do check out GFX Labs and Poppy Finance and Etherlands, all the rest of our main projects.

Sean Butterfield (01:03:04): Awesome, well thanks again. Sami, thanks for joining as well. I hope everyone has a beautiful weekend and we&#39;ll do this again next time.

Sami Kassab (01:03:13): Yeah this was fun, thanks everyone!

Getty Hill (01:03:15): Thanks for having me, cheers!</div>

            <h2>State of Avalanche Q1 2022 Analyst Call Transcript</h2>
            <div class="content">If you would like to view the full recording of the live Crowdcast event, you can find it on our YouTube channel. You can also read the full Quarterly Report by James Trautman &lt;a href=&#34;https://messari.io/article/state-of-avalanche-q1-2022?referrer=category:all-research&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

Participants:

James Trautman - Messari research analyst
John Nahas - Ava Labs
Ed Chang - Ava Labs
Luigi DeMeo - Ava Labs
Nick Mussallem - Ava Labs

Jim Trautman (0:06): Okay, I think we&#39;re live. We&#39;re gonna get a check. Good thumbs up, good to go. All right. Perfect, all right. So good to see some of you again. Nick and John, we&#39;ve had a chance to meet once before. Luigi, welcome. I’m going to just kind of set the stage for why we are here in case we have some new folks joining us for the first time. Really, the purpose for us being here is that Messari has been working on quarterly reporting, similar to what we see in a traditional world especially in traditional finance when evaluating companies and these sorts of things but at the same time very very different. You know, it&#39;s like there&#39;s nothing traditional about what we&#39;re doing here, especially when it comes to reporting. The point is that capturing events and capturing data in different time series allows us to evaluate you know really how things are going whether that be through certain data, certain trends or simply you know strategies that any endeavor is putting into place and that could be companies involved, it can be enterprises utilizing the technology, as well as the community itself driving it forward. Really that&#39;s why we are here and we are revisiting now the first quarter of 2022. Subsequent to having covered the last quarter for 2021, which was a pivotal quarter for Avalanche. A lot is going on, so the first quarter of this year is no exception. It&#39;s the same story, we&#39;re not going to boil everything in an hour. There&#39;s a lot to cover so hopefully we cover everything. We&#39;re going to try to have a conversation that if it&#39;s the first time to this call or your first time kind of looking into what the Avalanche ecosystem is and what&#39;s going on, we want to be able to provide some insight there all the way down to really, really deep into the community and hopefully we can provide some insight at a deeper level so you know that&#39;s why we&#39;re here. Today we&#39;re really going to talk about you guys, introductions, a high overview of what we&#39;re seeing over the first quarter, and that involves the network at a high level of what&#39;s going on with the network. Specifically, forms of usage, daily transactions, and these sorts of things. That&#39;s more quantitative and then it&#39;s sort of trying to tie that then to the actual ecosystem and sort of bringing it back to more qualitative manners that fundamentally we can start to think about the value that&#39;s actually coming to this space. It&#39;s easy to look at price, market cap, and be like “oh it&#39;s valuable” and see this data but, what we&#39;re trying to do is really flesh out what&#39;s the driver. What&#39;s fundamentally happening here that&#39;s driving everything and what are the efforts that everyone that&#39;s involved, and how is that driving. That&#39;s ultimately why we&#39;re here. I&#39;m a research analyst with Messari and have the honor to cover the Avalanche network and ecosystem and cover it on a quarterly basis. So that&#39;s about me but from there let&#39;s just start with a quick introduction of who you guys are, who Ava Labs is, what is Avalanche for those that are just completely unfamiliar, and your relationship with the Avalanche network.

  
John Nahas (4:34): Nick, you want to kick it off with introducing yourself, and then I&#39;ll go.

  
Nick Mussallem (4:40): Sure. James thanks for having us back. Nick Mussallem, I&#39;m the head of product at Ava Labs and so my teams are really focused on the road mapping strategy, product strategy, and competitive analysis, and then we have a project management team that leads the execution of those. We have a very talented design team that takes that strategy and makes it visual and considers the user experience. And then we also have a product analytics team that really kind of tells us how we&#39;re doing once we take things out to market. That&#39;s a summary of me and our teams.

  
John Nahas (5:17): John Nahas, Vice President, Co-Head of BD, I oversee the BD team at Ava Labs covering five verticals: DeFi, GameFi, culture, and social. So NTF’s,  institutional capital markets, as well as exchanges and wallets. We&#39;ve got Luigi here from the DeFi team and on GameFi so I’ll let Luigi introduce himself.

  
Luigi DeMeo (5:43): Thanks, John. Hey guys, Luigi DeMeo head of DeFi here at Ava Labs. I apologize in advance for the video and audio quality, but I span across BD and the strategy of all of our labs for DeFi and help grow this ecosystem as much as possible.

  
John Nahas (6:08): Can we get Ed in here?

  
Jim Trautman (6:10): I&#39;d say not yet. We&#39;ll dive into that a little bit more.  We&#39;ll let Ed in when we can. We&#39;re limited to the number of folks that we can have on the call so we&#39;ll have to bring people in as we get into the deeper dives into specific topics. So I guess pretty quickly to any of you, what is it and what is Avalanche. We&#39;ve discussed this before, but again for anybody that&#39;s new, what is it and what is Ava Labs’ relationship to it?

  
John Nahas (6:45): Absolutely. So Ava Labs, where we all work, is the firm that created the Avalanche blockchain. Now Avalanche is an open-source, Layer One blockchain so Ava Labs is a service provider to the Avalanche Foundation. We help with BD, with marketing and development on the protocol level, as well as a lot of other work that we do with enterprises and partners. Avalanche, as most of you know, is a new Layer One blockchain launched in September of 2020. Avalanche utilizes a novel new consensus which is the Avalanche consensus which allows us to achieve speed, high throughput, and the entirety of the network is actually very eco-friendly. Based on a recent expert study, the entirety of the Avalanche blockchain utilizes 46 U.S. households worth of carbon which is really low in the proof-of-stake family relative to some others in our group and infinitely more green than the proof-of-work chains of course. Avalanche is a multi-chain architecture. We have an X-Chain where you&#39;re able to create, mint, and burn assets with limited business logic. We have a P-Chain where validation delegation occurs, but also the ability to create permissioned or permissionless chains, what we call subnets, which I&#39;m sure we&#39;re going to dive into a little bit later. And then of course our C-Chain which is our EVM compatible smart contract chain. That&#39;s where a majority of the action that you see in DeFi and NFT’s is occurring so think of us as an L1, but in some capacities, you can even think of us as a Layer Zero allowing for a true Web3 economy to grow and to see the transfer value continue.

  
Jim Trautman (8:25): Great sense. Okay, thank you for the introduction. Let&#39;s kind of just move into why we&#39;re here and really set down Q1 of this year. So I&#39;m going to share my screen. Hopefully, we might see all of us for a moment. Just let me know when you see this sort of report in front of you. Good on that?

  
Nick Mussallem (9:08): Yeah, we can see it.

  
Jim Trautman (9:25): Okay great. All right, so as I mentioned we are now more or less tracking in a 90-day interval the development and progression of the Avalanche ecosystem, the Avalanche network. Sort of very quickly revisiting the fourth quarter of 2021 because while we can always just look at a snapshot of the last three months or the quarter, there&#39;s always a relationship to the prior quarter that we need to bring into the discussion and one thing that we&#39;d asked last quarter because it was an explosive quarter at the end of the day and all given fronts of every metric that you can evaluate and every partnership and everything that was going on in terms of any given growth strategy, we asked why. Some things are not in this report and John you had mentioned the importance and we spoke about it at length last quarter about one of the things that is important to anyone that will engage with the Avalanche ecosystem is the eco-friendly carbon footprint that the blockchain leaves. In this quarter there was actually more data that came out about that and it&#39;s not in this report because it&#39;s not easily tied to the data that we&#39;re evaluating. I just wanted to call that out and then it is a big reason for folks to want to use this particular platform. That said, there were many partnerships executed and things that were basically in the works as we headed into the first quarter of 2022, and the narrative really that I took away from this first quarter is that there was continued growth. What I’m kind of showing here right now, and we&#39;ll step away from this is what the report is all about and I just want to share with the audience what we&#39;re trying to do is give any reader key takeaways of the quarter and provide data, provide some background on Avalanche itself and ultimately tie it back to anything qualitatively going on. So just a preview of the report itself. Let&#39;s see, let&#39;s focus more so on the data that&#39;s within the report itself. We want to make sure you all can see this. That the state of Avalanche Q1 2022, is it visible to you all?

  
Nick Mussallem (12:28): Yeah, James we can see we&#39;re on the Avalanche key metrics summary page.

  
Jim Trautman (12:31): Perfect, okay. So as I mentioned we did see continued growth and in the report, I refer to it I think in one spot as modest growth, but that&#39;s really compared to the fourth quarter when you see network usage and network financial metrics growing at 500% or 600% and so on and so forth and I think in some cases into the thousands of percentage points. In Q1 we saw continued growth, but not like we saw in Q4, but calling out that it&#39;s still growth. What stood out to me was continued growth in active daily addresses. So just regular interaction with the network. We saw a 33%  increase in that metric as well as daily transactions. One of the other ones that stands out to me again is we knew we saw a 72% increase in revenue and from an evaluation point of view, that actually put downward pressure on what we call the price-to-sales ratio which suggests, you know, it&#39;s not perfectly vetted from the financial perspective on the complete meaningful point that this metric has, but relatively when you look at it across the space there is some insight from it. And what we&#39;re leading to is again, there&#39;s always a question as to why. Here&#39;s the Avalanche address group and of course, we see over the fourth quarter amazing growth and then we get into the New Year and it was actually in January that we saw an all-time high of active address growth and there was a statistic in there that the first week of January actually consisted of more activity than all of October, but since then we&#39;ve sort of stabilized. So that&#39;s the other narrative. A lot of times what we see in other networks is a lot of growth, and then it subsides. It reverses course and it&#39;s volatile. And while there&#39;s some volatility here, we&#39;re still seeing some stability in that. Well, actually, I shouldn&#39;t say some, but quite a bit of stability in activity. Similarly, it&#39;s the same with daily transactions. We&#39;re seeing an upward trend there and we have plotted here against that transaction fees. So I wanted to kind of start with that. As we think about why the continued growth in activity, daily transactions, and also interestingly enough what&#39;s going on with these transactions? So I&#39;ll come back to that but, in my findings, and you guys can speak to this, but as we crossed over into the New Year there was the really the launch, the unleashing of the custom EVM subnets. I think that&#39;s part of what we were seeing here. Also, I had seen some releases of Apricot. But first, if I may ask, what is the importance of the EVM subnet? And there was a JSON file that was also released that I believe made it very easy for folks to develop and create their own EVM custom subnet. Can you explain a little bit about that shift and what that means?

  
John Nahas (16:33): James, I&#39;ll turn this over to Nick and then to Luigi to add on to the subnet, but real quick just want to recap some of the important things that you highlighted. We&#39;ve seen sustainable and consistent growth to your point. There&#39;s usually a burst and then it tapers off. We&#39;ve seen the doubling of transactions, we&#39;ve seen continued usage, we&#39;ve seen continued growth with new applications continuing to grow, new innovation on the chain, new projects, new teams building. So that initial kick that we got from Q4 has really continued into Q1 and I know we&#39;re going to discuss a lot of the things that we have coming that came about in Q1 that are really going to propel us in Q2, but I think it&#39;s a really important metric, to highlight that there&#39;s a consistent and sustainable growth in users and transactions and in partnerships across the board. But to your point on the EVM subnets, Nick, do you want to jump in?

  
Nick Mussallem (17:34): Sure. So we&#39;re at a very exciting time where we start to see GameFi really start to explode on-chain and with the advent of any kind of high transaction high throughput application you&#39;re going to need to be able to horizontally scale, and subnets of course are our horizontal scaling solution. It&#39;s been a very exciting quarter as we&#39;ve launched DeFi Kingdoms onto that subnet. So as we start to do this we&#39;re starting to tackle a lot of the questions around subnets are they&#39;re ready to be used. You can deploy them very easily. There&#39;s a ton of documentation on them but there&#39;s a whole satellite of utilities that need to be there in order to properly support subnets which is while we&#39;re moving into the development of Core and which is our wallet experience which is going to have support for all subnets which we&#39;ll be launching very soon as well as explorer support.  Each and every subnet needs to have its own explorer. So we&#39;re building out the mechanism to launch these subnets. But when you launch them, you also need to launch the utilities rim which also includes things like API’s and our endpoints that are needed to successfully run them. So that&#39;s what we&#39;re seeing around subnets. We&#39;ve got the baseline technology there and we&#39;re starting to see rapid usage of it in very innovative ways so we keep making it smoother and easier for the builders and also for the users to access them and engage with them and really leverage other kinds of utilities to get the most out of them. That&#39;s the focus in Q1 and then going into Q2 as well.

  
John Nahas (19:20): Luigi, do you want to touch upon the importance of EVM subnets of course in regards to DeFi and everything else?

  
Luigi DeMeo (19:23): Yeah, I&#39;d be happy to. So I think Nick touched on it well. Subnet EVM allows you to deploy a subnet in one line of code. It&#39;s an EVM-based subnet so what this allows is it allows applications to deploy on the Avalanche C-Chain where a lot of our activity sits. Once they get to a certain level of activity and require more transactions and throughput, they can easily divert into their own subnet once they build the community and kind of naturally horizontally scale the network. What that does is two things: it allows the transactions on the main chain or the C-Chain to go down and fees go down, but it also allows overall network throughput to go up. This is just a way of horizontal scaling. Just to touch on the address chart a little bit just to give a little context, I think it&#39;s important to look at those numbers from a relative perspective. Crypto in general topped at the end of November and since then we&#39;ve sort of seen it across the board, whether it be Bitcoin, Ethereum, alt chains, Coinbase earnings across the board, we&#39;ve sort of seen a stagnation since that time period. What&#39;s important for Avalanche is Avalanche was able to experience explosive growth and usage and retain all that usage during this time period. I think that&#39;s the key. People came for new incentives, especially as it relates to Avalanche Rush and DeFi and they stayed and I think that&#39;s the important component to think about from that standpoint.

  
Jim Trautman (20:59): Yeah definitely. That&#39;s again one of my takes, and by the way as an analyst with Messari, I&#39;m really not in the community. I&#39;m not as far down as everybody else probably is when it comes to the Avalanche ecosystem. My job is simply to look at data, try to understand it, look at trends, see what&#39;s going on there and let it drive the discussion. The takeaway primitive where Q1 was again, continued growth and what I am referring to as stability and I see it as a potential foundation for the next potential wave of growth whether that comes through NFT’s, DeFi, GameFi, enterprise or commercial uses. We&#39;ll see, but that was my takeaway so I echo your sentiment about that stability. One of the things I wanted to talk about a little bit more was vertical scaling but we probably don&#39;t have time to go that far into that topic in particular. But really quickly, I do want to revisit what we see here in the past in a lot of volatility with the daily transactions on average up until the point where there was a release of Apricot. After that point, that was right here, what we saw is I think an actual impact from that release and I think that&#39;s very interesting to see. I would call this period of time very stable compared to what we saw in the past. Especially at a time when daily transactions on average are going up. A couple of statistics about daily transactions by the way; on average Avalanche is approaching about 74% of Ethereum&#39;s daily transactions on average. There were times when it reached about 90% or more, roughly a little bit more than what Ethereum was processing on any given day. Meanwhile, transaction fees are stabilizing. There is still a little bit of an uptrend that&#39;s moving in tandem with network users and transactions. This is all happening now at the same time as subnets are rolling out.  So should we expect to see daily transaction fees continue to stabilize and even if anything, reverse course as more subnets are launched?

  
Nick Mussallem (23:53): Yeah, so James I can jump in there. Absolutely. I think what you&#39;re seeing a lot in the increase of transactions has a lot to do with GameFi and just the nature of the bulk of what comes through there. The kind of horizontal scaling work that&#39;s done as a part of Apricot in the five phases really focuses on those things, which is how do we take the original mainnet launch and how do we make it faster? How do we reduce the fees? How do we make it more stable? How do we improve liveness? That&#39;s the focus and we&#39;ll continue to focus on that, but as we start to see other projects that come in and say need their own subnet because they want to have specific functionality that maybe is around lower fees higher throughput and they&#39;re starting to use things like pre-compiles that are specific to gaming. That will allow them to achieve these things very easily and when those games start to move into the subnets you&#39;ll start to see congestion on the mainnet drop and then you&#39;ll start to see fees drop. In summary, the continued focus on Apricot in the horizontal scaling of the mainnet implementation plus the advent and the maturity of subnets will have both of those effects. Faster transactions, lowering fees, and also providing scaling solutions.

  
John Nahas (25:24): I think it&#39;s important to add on to Nick&#39;s point. As you mentioned, fees have gone down. They are ticking a little bit up as usage ticks up but I think Avalanche as a platform prioritizes safety and liveness above any and all things. So in this respect, we are taking a very conservative approach. We would rather have a little bit higher fees, but have the network continue to run without any interruption, without any downtime, without any issues, because ultimately that&#39;s the goal. You need to be on 24/7/365 to keep up with this existing market. If we were to be a little too aggressive, we could end up having some issues as we&#39;ve seen across the board with others and that&#39;s just not the attitude or the stance that we would like to take. We&#39;d rather be on the cautious side, on the conservative side, and work to bring down the transaction fees gradually to a comfortable spot that doesn&#39;t affect network usage.

  
Jim Trautman (26:40): Yeah that makes perfect sense. And look, I think with any of these networks there are always these trade-offs and there&#39;s a responsible way of rolling them out that doesn&#39;t just happen overnight. So there&#39;s a strategy to make it work with a long-term vision. That&#39;s what we&#39;re going to track again and that&#39;s why we&#39;re doing what we&#39;re doing. We&#39;re going to be able to, next quarter, continue on with this trend and see with the number of subnets that launch, how much activity from each, and what sort of impact that has. But at the end of the day, we still know that vertical scaling and horizontal scaling is underway and what we&#39;re seeing now is more of a stable trend.

And then, of course, a strategy is in place, so I found this very interesting. I found this chart and data very interesting. Now, really quickly, I do want to dive into what it means in terms of revenue. Some folks out there are concerned if the transaction fees go down, then that means there&#39;s less revenue to the protocol. But I don&#39;t think that&#39;s necessarily true. I think that&#39;s a bit to be determined, but I do call in this analysis there&#39;s clearly a relationship between the value of the network versus the revenue. So if daily revenue were to go down as a result of subnets, and there is a relationship that holds the value of it in the short term, I&#39;m concerned that the value of the network is going to go down. But the benefits of the subnet, correct me if I&#39;m wrong, are of course in addition to being able to scale and thinking about it long-term it opens up not only use cases, but it will allow for the ecosystem to expand in other ways that will drive additional value. One of those other pieces that I think about is the infrastructure itself. Every subnet will participate in validating the network so I would expect that while transactions need to go down or stabilize, however that will look, we&#39;re going to see an expansion of the network itself. The number of validators going up the distribution of stake, further moving it, and being more diversified. Is that is that fair to say in question one? Then question two is if that is fair to say, what does that mean about the value of the network in your opinion?

  
Nick Mussallem (29:36): Sure so John why don&#39;t I kick this off and then you can. So I think strategically we don&#39;t feel like we want the cost of using the network to have to go up in order to drive underlying chain revenue or the value. So our goal is always going to be to make the chain affordable. As we make the chain affordable we also want to be able to scale it. These are the hard parts, right? How do you scale horizontally? How do we achieve that? We&#39;re achieving that with subnets. So we really will just keep scaling the network horizontally, providing the necessary utilities for builders to get to market affordably and quickly, and easily. With things like explorers, wallets, RPC endpoints, and interoperability between subnets to subnets, and subnets to mainnets, and subnets to other chains. So if we feel that we can provide all of that value in an easy-to-use package then we&#39;re going to be giving the users what they really want which is a very affordable chain that also scales.

  
Jim Trautman (30:48): Got it. Okay well, I think we got into that enough. It&#39;s an important trend that we&#39;re seeing. It&#39;s an interesting thing. There&#39;s a lot of chatter in the world in and outside of the community. Of course, other communities that will point these sorts of things out and have concerns but it&#39;s not if you just take a step back. Think about it, to determine what is actually happening here, it&#39;s really interesting, in my opinion on that front, so and I think everything that you said right there makes sense on the direction of usage and where its value will come from and its ability to scale.

  
Nick Mussallem (31:40): James, I&#39;ll just throw real quickly there that every validator that validates subnets has to be validated. The kind of magic number is no less than five. Each validator has to stake a box right and we didn&#39;t want to have to enforce that every subnet use AVAX as its native token because that&#39;s taking flexibility away from the builder which would have been an obvious choice in order to increase the usage of the underlying token. But we think that there&#39;s a bunch of other kinds of network means from having subnets that will increase the utilization of AVAX and the underlying tokens that are launched on these subnets and so that is a whole growth system.

  
Jim Trautman (32:22): Yeah for sure and I think part of that will show up in the development and decentralization aspect as an overview in our reports as well. So it&#39;ll all be tied together and be really interesting to see. We&#39;ll probably talk about it more next. Okay, thank you for that. That&#39;s kind of like getting into the network overview aspect of what we&#39;re looking at quarterly. We could spend the entire hour discussing all of these things and going even further but since time&#39;s ticking, I do want to move into the ecosystem itself and developer activities. Then I think from here we&#39;ll end up diving a little bit further into DeFi and GameFi and we&#39;ll bring our GameFi folks on to the call. But really quickly, I just want to point out that over the course of Q1, we did see a pretty significant increase in core developer activity. I suspect that it has everything to do with everything that we just talked about including EVM custom subnets and as well. I think some new incentives are in play here. And two of those incentives will be referred to as the Multiverse Fund or Multiverse Incentive Program and the Culture Catalyst Program. Can you guys sort of just give a high level of what each of those programs really represents and what you&#39;re going after there and sort of the outcome that we&#39;ve seen so far?  Any partnerships that have come out of those programs and where there&#39;s some traction?

  
John Nahas (34:27): Absolutely, so I think as we remember from Q4, Rush is really what started a lot of the push for us to grow. That was a DeFi incentive program. We&#39;ve now moved on to both the Multiverse Incentive Program which is about $290 million worth of incentives to support the growth and expansion of subnets as well as a Culture Catalyst, which is a $100 million to support artists and creators of build or grow their fan base and launch assets on Avalanche. A key caveat here to keep in mind, something that Avalanche focuses on, or that we focus on, is incentivizing the user. A lot of people give out grants. A lot of people do a lot of things. Our core belief, and the way we look at growing adoption, is we want the best teams to come and deploy their products and projects on us. We want people to build on us, and if they do so we&#39;ll incentivize the user to come and try it. And then those incentives start to wean off as we&#39;ve seen with Rush. So that brought DeFi to the fore. Multiverses is focused on increasing the growth of subnets. So that&#39;s either incentives for users to come and try a specific subnet as we&#39;ve seen with DeFi Kingdoms which is doing about a quarter-million transactions a day right now. We&#39;re also building out an institutional subnet for DeFi. You might have seen some of the participants there. Jump, Wintermute Golden Tree Asset Management, Valkyrie Securities, amongst many others that are also coming into that group. What the point there is that we&#39;re going to really look to provide TradFi players who want to work in DeFi with a regulated kind of permission chain where they can do the things they would do in DeFi, but with trusted and KYC counterparties. If you&#39;re a financial institution you cannot be providing liquidity to a market or borrowing when you don&#39;t know who the other counterparty is or if that other person could be from a sanctioned country or on a no-fly list or anything of that nature. Now, in a permission DeFi subnet, you don&#39;t know who the counterparty is, but you know that all the parties in there have gone through the necessary checks so whether it&#39;s institutional DeFi, whether it&#39;s enterprise, whether it&#39;s GameFi, the multiverse is there to help support these people by either giving them incentives to stand up their own validators so that they can run their own subnet and that&#39;s in the form of AVAX. We&#39;ll give them some AVAX and get that back once they&#39;re set up on their feet. We&#39;ll do incentives like we did with DeFi Kingdoms to get users in there. So that&#39;s really the crux of multiverse, to really expand the usage and allow builders to really come and not have that overhead to launch a subnet. We&#39;ll help them out initially until they get up on their feet with that and then we&#39;ll get back what we need and let them kind of grow on their own. On the Culture Catalyst, I&#39;d love to get Ed to jump in on this as well. What we&#39;re really doing is spurring creators and artists. So we&#39;ve partnered with a great team at Op3n that&#39;s O-p-3-n, so it&#39;s an app that&#39;s akin to a Spotify for artists, creators, and musicians to really have a fan base. NFT’s that are more than just art but that link to communities that have fan access and engagement and I&#39;ll let Ed talk about the first one. The first project there that we announced at our summit in Barcelona and give kind of a high level as what we see coming down the pipe there.

  
Ed Chang (38:08): Yeah thanks, John. So like John said, we&#39;ve set aside a co-funding opportunity for up to $100 million for this program.  It’s called the Culture Catalyst. We are working with Op3n and they have the pulse on all things entertainment so you know the direct line to musicians, and you know film producers and IP and influencers. So everything we&#39;re going to be doing is really about jump-starting that NFT community on Avalanche and really fostering the growth there and bringing in more of a retail audience as well. The first project that we had announced at Summit is with Grimes the singer, the producer, and the director. She&#39;s actually, now with the birth of her second kid, looking to put together kind of an NFT children&#39;s book based around crypto. There&#39;s going to be a music video around that. Kind of a new song she&#39;s launching that&#39;ll be the first one that we announce. There are a few other really exciting ones in the pipeline geared around the film and music industries that we&#39;re really excited about. Think about NFT’s as membership NFT’s as your calling card to deeper access with some of these artists and apparel and other things that it unlocks. So we&#39;re really excited about what we&#39;re doing there.

  
John Nahas (39:22):Ed while once you jump in a little bit and talk about just multiverses and its impact on GameFi the growth that we&#39;ve seen in GameFi this quarter because I think that&#39;s really really stuck out the most.

  
Ed Chang (39:33): Yeah, so you know my core focus here has been on the GameFi side and we&#39;ve seen a lot of growth over the last two quarters. We&#39;ve gone from this narrative of a lot of these casual-like, idle games built, moving forward into more core double a triple a experiences we&#39;ve announced partnerships with a lot of these really new games. Here, looking at the launch of subnets, the first two subnets that are going to be launching. DeFi Kingdoms already launched and we&#39;ve got Crabada really close behind them following with the launch of battle mode. So, when we look at the pipeline of the different games out there, it&#39;s looking really healthy in terms of the games that we&#39;ve announced and that are in development right now. As well as some of the games that are kind of stealth right now that are waiting to be announced in this quarter and the latter half of this year.

  
Jim Trautman (40:32): Yeah, that makes sense. And again I think we can see that impacting all the activity as again, we started with this discussion around some developments and DeFi Kingdoms. We knew that was coming and that it went live right at the end of the quarter. There&#39;s more to say about it, but in the window of Q1, it was right at the end. I think it was the day or two before, and we actually did start to see data rolling in through various explorers as it relates to DeFi Kingdoms. So yeah, that&#39;ll be, I think, a hot topic for the next quarter. The other one is Crabada. Is that how you say it correctly?

  
Ed Chang (41:16): Yeah, Crabada, nailed it.

  
Jim Trautman (41:18): And again, DeFi Kingdoms is part of the multiverse program at this point. Obviously, there&#39;s going to be some incentive there to continue to develop a little bit. Can you just give us a real high level of what it is Crababada and this is generating a lot of activity on a test net right now. Can you just kind of give us a high level or is that where we bring in our expert on Crabada?

  
Ed Chang (41:55): Yeah, so Crabada is one of the early games in the ecosystem. At any given moment they&#39;re taking between 15-40 percent of the gas on the c-chain. People love the crabs. It&#39;s effectively like an idle game that you need three of these crab NFT’s to play. They are moving towards more of an Axi-type battle mode game and they&#39;ve got other things planned on their road map that they&#39;ve teased out. People are always running looting missions and mining missions and getting tokens from that and there&#39;s this whole economy and community built around that. So this is kind of their core game that they&#39;re launching their subnet on called the Swimmer Network. The vision here, the reason they&#39;re not calling it the Crabada subnet, is because they&#39;re looking to be more of a publisher of games. So they&#39;re going to be launching their idle game there, they&#39;re going to be launching their battle mode game and then they&#39;re looking to potentially bring on other titles who are looking to be on the subnet to capitalize on that community. So you can see where the economics get really interesting. Where they have an inflationary token called TUS, similar to Axi’s SLP but it drives more value. And now they have another mechanism that they can burn a lot of that TUS and they can also take some of that and go reward their validators. And if more and more games are using that in their marketplace for their games, there&#39;s that additive value being driven to the token and the network itself.

  
Jim Trautman (43:25): Makes sense. I was able to dig up some initial data on the Crabada subnets again, seeing it very quickly grow so collectively as we see more and more of this occur, we&#39;ll try to tie it back to the growth strategy that&#39;s in place as well as translates into the activity and the data that we&#39;re collecting along the way. I think DeFi Kingdoms and Crabada are examples and I know it&#39;s impossible for us to exactly pinpoint what is driving every aspect of the activity, but when you start to sort of timeline things and time stamp and look at how the network is reacting to it, I think it&#39;s pretty clear that that there is an impact from the rollout of subnets and really the introduction of GameFi into the Avalanche ecosystem. So anything else on the DeFi front? We&#39;re already 10 minutes to the hour so?

  
John Nahas (44:32) I&#39;ll just add Luigi&#39;s been having connection issues. But, I&#39;ll just add on the DeFi front, I think what you really saw, and this was part of our ambition and our goal that we set for ourselves in Q4 and that really played out in Q1, was that you know, with Rush, we brought blue-chip DeFi protocols on like Aave, Curve, Sushi etc. That gave people comfort coming to use it and then we saw existing native Avalanche applications grow. We saw new Avalanche native applications grow, but what we saw really in Q1 is really the launch of new novel projects on Avalanche that previously didn&#39;t exist or were tried to be built somewhere else. We saw some teams that were native to Ethereum such as Alpha Labs launch their Alpha X product on us first. The speed of the chain, and the lower cost made it easier for people within other communities to develop applications that have been launched on Avalanche and for the developer community within Avalanche to grow whether it be Platypus, which was just a single-sided stable swap. We recently had Yeti launch. We&#39;ve seen the Platypus wars akin to the Curve wars. Now we&#39;re starting to see the Joe wars akin to that as well so we&#39;re really starting to see a native community of builders and developers grow build projects on Avalanche to continue that growth in DeFi, in terms of development and new contracts. So you know all the metrics that matter have definitely been trending in the right way so we are really excited to see the community continue to grow, and to innovate as the network grows.

  
Jim Trautman (46:23): Yeah for sure. A few quick bits that I gathered on the DeFi front is that Platypus Finance is the fastest growing DeFi protocol over the quarter. There was what is referred to as the long tail, so the number of protocols that have a million or more in TVL, stabilized. So kind of look at that as a greater distribution of TVL so I think that&#39;s a sign of health in the DeFi space. You know of course Rush has a little bit to do with that and you know all sorts of things that also then translates into developer activities so we saw a greater number of growth in contracts deployed over the quarter and that&#39;s all tied into that. We&#39;d love to dive a little bit further into that and try to boil the ocean inside of an hour here. But let&#39;s just take a few quick minutes to like one or two high-level events that stand out to you. To me the Summit stands out to me. I was there and didn&#39;t have a chance to meet you all but gathered a lot of information. I guess a few of the top-of-mind sort of partnerships or efforts that you guys are working on. Maybe it&#39;s  Grimes or maybe these other things and again I&#39;m talking about a minute because I want to leave the time for some questions, as well as what&#39;s ahead. I could mention Core, we know that that&#39;s on the way, and user experience is on the way. So yeah, putting it on you to like two minutes more or less, what&#39;s exciting to you as of recent developments in terms of continued development, and what&#39;s ahead, what can we expect, if you can, whatever you can show?

  
John Nahas (48:15): So I’ll kick this off and then I’ll turn over to Nick to talk on the product side. I think instead of two I’m going to give you three things. I think one, what you saw was a continued growth on the BD side of the infrastructure level and that kind of the pipes and the roads that helped to build out an ecosystem so you saw USDT launch after USDC  launched natively at the end of Q4, but you&#39;ve seen both of those start to grow. You&#39;ve seen an expansion in exchanges whether it be FTX or others. You&#39;ve seen exchanges now on onboard USDC and USDT native to Avalanche. All these things, custody,  staking, and wallets, just continue to grow so we&#39;re reaching more people. The pipeline in and out of the network is getting easier. Fiat on-and-off ramps and everything there. So that really is the foundational layer that&#39;s been growing that allows the builders to come in for the users to try the network and to grow from there. I think the second thing of course is the Culture Catalyst and Multiverse to really drive continued growth with subnets across GameFi, DeFi, enterprise. I think you saw with enterprise last quarter I know he touched on Deloitte, but of course, Ava labs is a partner with Mastercard Star Path program and working with them to kind of put together some pretty cool POC’s hopefully in the future as well as Lemonade right an Insurtech insurance provider to work and create a proof-of-concept Parametric Insurance Program that can be rolled out globally to those that are underserved in the insurance markets but hopefully one day can lead to the inclusion of smart contracts from blockchain technology into traditional insurance. That&#39;s the second thing and I think the third thing to culminate the quarter was truly the Summit. I think it was more a culmination of several years worth of work for us to arrive at that point. It was fantastic to see so many people. I&#39;m pretty sure we could have had a lot more but we&#39;re really looking forward to continuing that trend. That was our first Summit, our first inaugural Avalanche event and I think it was a great illustration of the diversity of this community whether it be builders, partners, investors, friends, and everything across the board. I think what you&#39;re gonna see this coming quarter is really the multiverse expand, the growth of subnets and Culture Catalyst really take a leading role going from there. I&#39;ll turn it over to Nick to talk on the product part.

  
Nick Mussallem (50:45): Sure. I&#39;ll be real quick because I know we want to take some questions. So I think we&#39;ve talked about scaling and that&#39;s a huge priority for us. We&#39;re attacking that with subnets and then the second goal is to really make crypto on Avalanche more accessible to everybody. How do we leverage this great technology and that solution is in Core. So Core is really this curated Web3 operating system that allows users to really access the best parts of crypto in a way that they can understand everything&#39;s native to Avalanche itself so you&#39;re not having to know how to add custom tokens or deal with smart contracts directly. It&#39;s really designed to really give people a comfortable experience to be able to interact with the chain and then two other things is the Bridge, so the addition of Bitcoin support to the Bridge so the ability to natively bridge bitcoin across. You&#39;ll be able to do that through the Core extension so we&#39;ll have bridging embedded into the extension itself to make it as easy as possible. And then finally make it easier for the builders to get to market and that really is expanding our partnership with AWS and starting to look to ways to deploy and manage blockchain and specifically manage subnets.

  
Jim Trautman (51:59): Perfect, thank you. I know we&#39;re speeding up here in terms of all the concepts and discussions to get into, so really quick I&#39;m going to wrap it up in like 30 seconds to try to field a couple of questions and we&#39;ll move on. Again, continued growth, and stabilization of the network across metrics and across the ecosystem. We saw the EVM custom subnets kind of roll out things that we didn&#39;t mention partnerships with other protocols like Terra partnerships with enterprises, Wildlife Studios, DeFi Kingdoms launching Crabada launching, a lot going on so you know I guess for the folks that aren&#39;t terribly familiar here, take a look at the quarterly report to get more detail you know as well as all the resources that are out there available to the community. All right, so quickly going to try and take at least one question if I can figure out exactly where they are.

  
John Nahas (53:08): Yeah, let&#39;s grab some questions.

  
Jim Trautman (53:28): How about that? I&#39;m still sharing, aren&#39;t I? Here we go. Let me squeeze into that. We might go a minute or two over. All right, let&#39;s see. “I think Terra is one of the main competitors for Avalanche. How does Avax plan to compete with Terra and especially its stable coin? Does Avalanche plan to release its own stablecoin?”

  
John Nahas (54:04): Can you repeat it one more time James? You cut out for me in the beginning.

  
Jim Trautman (54:06): Sorry about that. So I just mentioned Terra. “I think Terra is one of the main competitors for Avalanche. How does Avax plan to compete with Terra and especially its Avalanche plan to release its own stablecoin?”

  
John Nahas (54:25): So that&#39;s actually a great question for the simple reason that you know there&#39;s a narrative out there that L1’s or the other L1’s have to be competitors and we don&#39;t see Terra as a competitor. We&#39;re all in this to grow this pie in this industry and this entire ecosystem together. That&#39;s why we partnered with Terra. We partnered with Terra as you might have seen in the news, and AVAX is going to be backing UST through that purchase. Luigi can jump in and get some more color on that partnership but we don&#39;t have any plans on launching a stable coin. Why would we when there&#39;s a great one out there that we can partner with and help solidify? So Luigi, do you want to jump in and talk a little bit about that?

  
Luigi DeMeo (55:00): Yeah sure. Sorry for the issues again from before, but yeah I mean we obviously had this very large announcement with respect to Terra and you know Terra&#39;s main goal is at least for my conversations with Do [Kwon] and that team is to grow UST adoption. Terra is a zone of Cosmos that is the chain that they do and LUNA is the staking token of that zone which helps secure the network. So that inherently drives some value to that token which helps to secure it for the stablecoin. From our standpoint, we have one of the most robust DeFi ecosystems out there which is obviously attractive for a decentralized stablecoin. So the partnership really makes sense from both sides. The DeFi ecosystem that needs a decentralized stablecoin and then the decentralized coin that wants to be integrated within a very robust and diverse DeFi ecosystem which Avalanche has at this point. So I think it&#39;s just a natural fit from that lens.

  
Jim Trautman (56:04): Makes sense. I mean you mentioned last quarter John that you know it&#39;s really not about competition. I think even in my report I called out a competitive analysis that&#39;s more of a traditional way of evaluating this. It&#39;s more of like a peer group, everybody has their own place and it&#39;s all about driving things forward and of course a lot of the credit goes back to Ethereum and the Ethereum community. So, we are out of time. I wish that we could ask more questions but I know that you guys are super busy and I want to be respectful of that so next time I will be a better moderator and try to leave a little time in the end for questions and of course, I would say to you all and the community and all the audience I’m wide open to feedback on any metrics that aren&#39;t in this report. Anything that you would like to see, questions that you would like you to know, we&#39;re wide open to that and we&#39;d love to continue evaluating and just continue evaluating and continue the conversation going forward. So with that, thank you all. Thanks, everybody for joining. Thank you team for joining us. It&#39;s always a pleasure chatting with you guys. So that&#39;s where I&#39;ll leave it. If you have any last words, you have another event that you&#39;d like to invite us to, let us know.

  
John Nahas (57:40): I did wrap up the last broadcast by inviting everyone to the Summit so I wish we had another summit coming up right away or else I would. But we actually will be doing a pretty big activation in July around the Formula E race in New York. It&#39;ll be in Brooklyn. We are New York-based. We&#39;re Brooklyn-based, so we will be doing some really cool activations around that date so stay tuned for an Avalanche House in July in New York. Hope to see you all there. Thanks, James.

  
Jim Trautman (58:07): Awesome. Thank you, guys. Take care

  
Nick Mussallem (58:09): Great. Thanks, guys.</div>

            <h2>State of dYdX Q1 2022</h2>
            <div class="content">Download the PDF version of this report by clicking here.pdf).

Key Insights

dYdX trading volume fell 23.8% in Q1 compared to the previous quarter, which coincided with decreases seen in other spot-based DEXs and with a broader decrease in crypto market capitalization as a whole.
The number of weekly traders using the protocol has been trending upwards from January to the end of the quarter.
New account depositors in the quarter fell for the second quarter in a row after peaking in Q3 2020
dYdX announced new features on the protocol, including beta-testing of a new mobile app, a gamified Trading Leagues platform, unique user profiles, and a corresponding new NFT avatar collection called Hedgies.
One of the most anticipated objectives for the remainder of the year is the launch of dYdX V4, which will fully decentralize the protocol and prevent any single party from controlling the protocol’s revenue.

Introduction to dYdX

dYdX Protocol operates a derivatives exchange on the Layer-2 StarkEx network. Cleverly named after the mathematical notation, the hybrid-decentralized exchange offers perpetual futures contracts similar to the ones found on Binance, FTX, and other centralized exchanges. The protocol’s ultimate goal is to build a fully decentralized derivatives exchange where no single party, including the team itself, can claim authority over the protocol’s fundamental operations.

dYdX was founded by Antonio Juliano, an ex-Coinbase engineer, who began working on the idea in the summer of 2017. The protocol’s first two products, Expo and Solo, were built for margin trading on Ethereum. After seeing the explosion of perpetuals trading on Bitmex in 2019, dYdX decided to become the first DeFi protocol to trade perpetuals. The launch of perpetuals for major tokens like BTC and ETH quickly grew in popularity among traders seeking to use margin. Ease of use was later further improved with the addition of StarkEx layer-2 rollups in 2021. In hindsight, it is quite clear that dYdX’s shift to perpetuals has paid off — the protocol has retained its status as the leading DeFi derivatives exchange.

During Q4 2021, the dYdX community lowered market maker thresholds and increased staking rewards for the protocol’s native DYDX token (stkDYDX). Additionally, the dYdX Foundation rolled out a mobile app in beta on iOS; started Trading Leagues, an open-ended trading competition; launched public trader profiles; and unveiled Hedgies, an NFT collection.

Macro Overview

At the end of Q1 2022, dYdX operated 33 markets, ranging from layer-1s networks to blue-chip Ethereum DeFi tokens. Just like centralized derivatives exchanges, BTC and ETH comprise the majority of trading volume at 45.8% and 39.6%, respectively. The high trading volume of BTC and ETH, consequently, also makes it the highest source of fee revenue for the protocol.

Fee revenues are earned by the protocol as a percentage of each trade. Just recently, on April 19th, the protocol ended a temporary fee holiday where those fees were reduced by up to 66%. In our analysis, it’s worth noting derivative exchanges operate with more capital efficiency since most trades are leveraged and fees are taken on each trade’s notional size. A protocol like dYdX can stretch their revenue per dollar of collateral metric further than other DeFi business models. For example, comparing Q1 revenue-to-TVL ratios for dYdX and Uniswap shows the former calculating out to $0.14 per dollar and the latter achieving a fraction of that at $0.02 per dollar.

Traders are incentivized to use the protocol through a Trader Rewards program. The mechanism distributes 3,835,616 native DYDX tokens each epoch (which lasts 28 days), to participants who have paid fees or hold positions in active contracts. A special formula is used to determine how those tokens are distributed to qualifying users. The rewards program is scheduled to last five years and is designed to boost trading volume on dYdX.

With that in perspective, dYdX facilitated $191.3 billion of trading volume in Q1 2022. The number was 23.8% lower than the total volume seen in Q4 2021. One big reason was the change of sentiment around crypto markets. In Q4, BTC and ETH both hit all-time-highs, and NFTs saw a resurgence in popularity. As a result, trading activity increased across the ecosystem, and dYdX was no exception. Interest in crypto was bound to revert back to the mean, bringing total dYdX volumes down with it.

Further trading behavior was analyzed in a recent report by Max Holloway and the team at Xenophon Labs. The team concluded that in the current rewards mechanism, traders are incentivized to maximize rewards by making trades at the end of each epoch. Making those trades towards the end provides two things: (1) traders receive their rewards shortly after making their trades, and (2) traders can better quantify the value of expected rewards.

A quick glance at the chart above superficially supports that data. Every four weeks, there is the occasional week of high volume as each epoch ends. However, incentivized activity is common with DeFi protocols, and it’s possible trading levels would be more evenly distributed if the rewards program was removed. Debates within governance have also taken place to determine if the rewards program should be adjusted to measure activity on a daily basis instead of by each epoch. Support was garnered from the community but no action has taken place to change the distribution of rewards.

New depositors, a proxy for new accounts, have decreased significantly since a hot Q3 2021. The metric declined 22.6% in Q1 after declining 75.3% in Q4 2021. A total of 4,894 deposits were made in Q1, bringing the total depositor count over the last year to 50,541. Although the slowdown of new accounts may seem like a challenge, the number of dYdX traders is naturally lower than spot-based DEXs because trading on leverage can be too risky for the average investor.

The weekly trader count had a positive trend throughout the quarter. Even excluding the global minimum for the first week of January (ending January 2), weekly trader counts went from 2,838 to 3,345 with a high of 4,344 traders in the second-to-last week. The most significant weekly decline occurred for the week ending March 6, which was a chaotic week for markets in general following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

Open interest is a measure of the number of open contracts held by traders. When traders open a position, the total open interest number increases; when they close out of a contract, the open interest count decreases. The metric is commonly used as an indicator to confirm trends in markets.

Open interest edged upwards this past quarter to end at $1.3 billion. That value includes both long and short positions. Although it is difficult to glean direct information purely from open interest, The rise in open interest this past quarter could be a sign that speculators are re-entering the market after the previous quarter’s slowdown.

Perpetuals Market Spotlight

The first version of dYdX’s perpetuals product started with three markets: Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Chainlink. Over the following two years, dYdX expanded to 33 markets supporting a variety of widely traded tokens, with an emphasis on blue-chip Layer-1s and DeFi protocols. This report focuses on the markets with the highest Q1 volume: BTC-USD, ETH-USD, and AVAX-USD.

BTC-USD

BTC-USD was the first market available through dYdX and is still widely traded. Total volume in Q1 was $87.6 billion, which was 20.8% lower than the previous quarter. The decline in trading volume is in line with the decline in overall trading volume for the protocol. However, in Q1, the trading volume of BTC perpetuals surpassed 2 million BTC tokens for the first time in a single quarter.

After comparing BTC trading activity on the protocol to the same activity on several centralized exchanges (FTX, Binance, Deribit, OKX, Bybit, BitMEX, and Bitfinex), the results showed that dYdX should be considered a serious competitor in the ecosystem. The protocol facilitated $87.6 billion in trades in the BTC perpetuals market, nearly the same amount as that of established exchanges such as Deribit and BitMEX.

Bitcoin open interest hit an all-time high in Q3 2021 amidst a frantic bull market. Many traders opened new contracts to gain margined exposure to the price movement. The count of outstanding tokens rose from just over 1,000 to an all-time high of 8,348 on October 19, 2021. Open interest then decreased in Q4, bottoming out at 4,620 tokens before finishing this past quarter about halfway between the local maximum and minimum at 6,547.

Daily bitcoin liquidations peaked on March 27 at $23.6 million. This particular day was notable as bitcoin returned to its breakeven price on the year and reached as high as $47,000 on the market. The token price increased 4.4% on the day, fueled by the $125 million purchase of BTC by the Luna Foundation Guard. Such a sudden intraday jump likely triggered a large number of liquidations by those who were holding short positions. The following day’s price was also particularly high, ranking as the fourth-highest day of liquidated contracts in the quarter.

ETH-USD

Cumulative ETH trading volume for the quarter fell to $75.7 billion. The largest trading day occurred on March 14 while the lowest volume day fell on January 30. The daily range for the quarter fell between $255,000 to $2.3 billion, which is a 10x range between the high and the low. This wide range ultimately rests outside of the control of the protocol and more on larger economic events driving high-volume or low-volume trading days.

dYdX held a strong market share in comparison to centralized exchanges in the ETH market. Out of the seven other exchanges, dYdX volumes came in third behind Binance and FTX, which remain the undisputed leaders of perpetuals trading. Nonetheless, adoption metrics highlight how valuable the DYDX token airdrop was to usage; dYdX activity as a percentage of centralized exchange volumes soared from a few basis points to single-digits immediately after the airdrop.

ETH’s open interest declined throughout Q4 but is now seeing an upward trajectory heading into Q2 2022. A closer look at the metric shows open interest increasing when ETH fell to $2,500, then decreasing when ETH hit the $3,000 range. It then proceeded to rise again when ETH dipped into the mid-$2000s before flatlining as ETH settled into a range right before the end of the quarter. The overall movement of ETH open interest follows closely with BTC open interest as a strong correlation between the two assets continues to persist.

The highest daily liquidations for ETH this quarter all took place in the first few weeks of January. This came at a time when the market was reversing many of the gains earned in Q4 2021. On January 21, the ETH market saw its highest day of liquidations in the quarter. Not surprisingly, the day was brutal in the markets; the price of ETH dropped low/mid-double-digit percentages from the previous day. Notably, $13.5 billion of open contracts were liquidated after those holding the position failed to maintain the margin ratio.

AVAX-USD

One reason for dYdX’s relative strength in AVAX trading compared to BTC or ETH is its position as a DeFi-native exchange. The protocol facilitated $4.6B worth of AVAX trades in Q1 while centralized competitors such as Bybit, BitMEX, Bitfinex, and Deribit only achieved 10% or less of the same volume. The only exchanges which outpaced dYdX were FTX and Binance at $20.0 billion and $59.0 billion, respectively.

AVAX open interest has been on the rise since August 2021 when the Avalanche network attracted attention as a popular, fast, cheap EVM-enabled network. As a result, in Q1 2022, open interest increased by 31.3%, going from 487,000 to 640,000 outstanding perpetual contracts. All of this occurred behind the backdrop of falling and then flattening AVAX token prices; the combination of falling AVAX prices but increased open interest could be read as a signal for increased investor interest in the blockchain network as a serious bet on the future.

Liquidations within the quarter amounted to $21.3 million. Peak liquidations were dispersed fairly evenly throughout the three months as the token underwent higher volatility relative to ETH and BTC. AVAX began the quarter priced above $110 and fell to a low point below $70 before bouncing back. The day with the most liquidations was January 7.

Trading Leagues, Profiles, and Hedgies

In an effort to continue attracting users, the dYdX announced a few new features to help gamify the trading experience. First, dYdX announced the creation of Trading Leagues in January. The leagues are a first-of-its-kind trading competition designed to boost volume by offering weekly prizes to the highest-performing traders. Prices are given out weekly (which dYdX refers to as a trading season) and vary depending on the specific league tier. Weekly cash prizes can approach $350,000. Users move between leagues according to their weekly performance. Think of the system like the one used for European soccer: the fear of relegation further incentivizes players to do well!

In conjunction with Trading Leagues, users are now able to create personal profiles. Other parties can select an individual profile and view the 30-day historical performance of that trader’s portfolio.

Hedgies were also introduced as NFT avatars for personal profiles. A collection of 4,200 unique NFTs was distributed on Ethereum starting February 1, 2022. Hedgies did not come with a mint cost; the only price to pay was gas fees. Subsequent mints beginning February 8 were given at the end of each trading season to the most profitable traders.

Source: Hedgies

Beyond their status as avatars, Hedgies come with practical utility. Holders of the NFT benefit from reduced fees on the dYdX protocol. Owning Hedgies increases the trader’s fee tier by one category. Since a higher fee tier (associated with a higher balance) decreases one’s trading fees, acquiring a Hedgie effectively increases capital efficiency for traders.

Governance Update

A few major governance proposals were active in the most recent quarter. As dYdX proceeds toward complete decentralization, governance will take on increasing importance in the management of the protocol.

January 7, 2022 - dYdX Grants Program

Reverie, a consultancy for DAOs, proposed to launch and manage a $6.25 million dYdX Grant Program (DGP). After passing the on-chain vote with unanimous support, 752,000 DYDX were moved from the Community Treasury to the Grants Multisignature Wallet (Multisig). As one of the largest community grant programs in DeFi, DGP increases the number of active contributors working on development, marketing, education, and other value accretive activities. The Grants Committee reviews all applications and controls the DGP Multisig.

February 1, 2022 - Liquidity Staking Pool Borrowing Requirements Framework

The Liquidity Staking Pool allows users to stake USDC for DYDX. The staked USDC is an interest-free, uncollateralized loan to pre-approved market makers, only to be used to provide liquidity to dYdX order books. While stakers do earn DYDX, they also incur counterparty risk, namely that a market maker won’t be able to pay back its loan.

To help add new, reliable, and creditworthy liquidity providers to the Liquidity Provider pool, the dYdX Foundation created a set of borrowing requirements. By passing the proposal with near-unanimous support, DYDX tokenholders, who still get the final say on who borrows staked USDC, agreed to use the framework to select borrowers. Under this new framework, prospective borrowers must qualify for Liquidity Provider Rewards in the preceding epoch (by providing more than 0.25% of maker volume), and create a public profile on the dYdX community forum with all the relevant disclosures, and agree to the revolving credit agreement.

February 12, 2022 - Reduce the threshold for receiving liquidity provider rewards to 0.25%

The dYdX Liquidity Provider Rewards program incentivizes market liquidity by giving DYDX to certain liquidity providers. This proposal, passed with almost unanimous support, lowered the minimum maker volume threshold required to start earning these rewards from 1% to 0.25%. This change bolsters liquidity by attracting more active capital from smaller, yet still consequential, market makers.

March 21, 2022 - Implement a Guernsey Purpose Trust for the dYdX Grants Program

Reverie’s proposal to implement a Guernsey purpose trust for the dYdX Grant Program passed with near unanimity. As a result, the committee and Multisig will turn into a Guernsey purpose trust structure: committee members will be trustees; multisig assets will become the purpose trust, and Reverie will be the enforcer. While maintaining the same level of tokenholder control, this new structure simultaneously increases functionality and reduces risk. Some benefits include allowing the conversion of DYDX to USDC (for grants) without tax liabilities, enabling off-chain agreements, and reducing legal liabilities for all parties.

dYdX Grant Program Updates

Since launching DGP at the beginning of the quarter (January 10, 2022), the program has pledged more than $2 million in grants. A few notable grants are listed below:

Approved:

Trading Strategy Bot: Bayswater Capital, a boutique investment bank based in South Africa, will build an open-source trading bot. Any dYdX trader, regardless of location, will be able to use the bot locally through a GitHub repo.

Tooling Page: Chaos Labs, a protocol security platform, will build a comprehensive webpage that includes funding rates (dYdX perpetual premiums), a rewards simulator to estimate trading rewards, and a command-line interface (CLI) trading tool.

In Progress:

Blockcrunch Podcast Sponsorship: Starting this month (April 2022), dYdX will become the primary sponsor of the Blockcrunch podcast for the next six months. Included in the sponsorship are brand shoutouts and commissioned guest episodes with members of the dYdX.

Completed:

Liquidation Alert Tool: A self-hosted tool that alerts users in their email, Discord, Slack, or Telegram when any of their dYdX positions are close to liquidation. The bot was built by Max Holloway.

DAO Organizational Structure Research: Davincifi received a grant to produce a research report examining the history of collective coordination and governance to provide actionable insights to dYdX. The complete report was published on Davincifi’s Substack and can be found here. Key takeaways from the report include investing in non-technical contributors, reducing the number of decision-makers whenever possible, and encouraging more participation from those contributing on the periphery of the ecosystem.

Roadmap

The biggest event on the horizon is the launch of dYdX V4. While V4 development is ongoing, the protocol also launched a new mobile app for on-the-go trading.

dYdX V4

At the beginning of Q1, dYdX Trading Inc. announced its plan to fully decentralize the dYdX protocol by the end of 2022. Right now, dYdX uses the StarkEx L2 as a settlement layer, but dYdX Trading Inc. runs an off-chain order book and matching engine on centralized servers and collects all trading fees. With dYdX V4, the matching engine and order book will be fully decentralized, and dYdX Trading Inc. will not control any part of the protocol or directly collect any trading fees. While dYdX Trading Inc. will continue to develop open-source software and support the protocol’s growth, aspects formerly under its purview such as market creation will be handed over to protocol governance (DYDX tokenholders).

V4 might also move beyond perpetuals and support other trading products (i.e., spot, margin, synthetics, etc.), expand and improve choices around margin and collateral, build rails to support permissionless market creation, and bring improvements to trading and market structure.

Due to potential constraints around throughput, finality, and fairness (frontrunning) this transition will be challenging. However, if executed, the step change in transparent, permissionless, high-performance trading and market creation will be monumental.

dYdX iOS app

In early March, dYdX became one of the first DeFi protocols to launch a native mobile application, albeit in a public beta. Onboarding through the priority waitlist was contingent on holding more than 10 DYDX or one Hedgie and doing greater than $1,000 in trade volume between March 9 and March 23. Additionally, eager beta testers can still join the referral waitlist by participating in social campaigns through Reddit, Twitter, etc. Once the app does publicly launch, all dYdX users will be able to trade and monitor positions on the go like they can with centralized exchanges (e.g., FTX, Binance, etc.) today.

Conclusion

Across the crypto derivatives market, there are two main types of exchanges: centralized exchanges and decentralized exchanges. Centralized exchanges typically have more resources but are hampered by regulations, marred by transparency concerns, and need to be trusted by users. Meanwhile, decentralized exchanges such as dYdX have fewer resources but offer solutions to the problems centralized exchanges face.

For dYdX, the belief that decentralized services will capture more of the market share in light of their advantages is backed by the work the team is doing. With a clear roadmap towards full decentralization and competitive trading volume, the protocol remains a formidable participant leading DeFi’s alternative derivatives exchanges.

Sector Returns

This week saw some of the least volatile trading within the crypto markets for quite some time. Patterns like this resemble a consolidation phase, which indicates that the markets could be getting ready to make significant moves in the near term. Most top assets on the sectors covered traded within single-digit ranges for the week. However, most sectors had one or two outliers that broke the trend and rallied into the double-digit gains. The currencies sector came out on top this week, gaining 1.20% while gaming fell behind with -3.4%.

Top Assets

The top assets by market capitalization category showed a mixed set of returns. Half of the assets yielded negative returns, while the other half ended the week on the green. However, Terra (LUNA) stood out as the only asset within the category to finish the week with a double-digit positive return. The Cosmos-based IBC chain’s native asset LUNA rose in price up to 22% before shedding almost half of it, ending the week with an 11.8% gain. Dogecoin (DOGE) took last place among top assets with -4.7% for the week.

DeFi Assets

DeFi was another sector with mixed returns. Four of the top ten DeFi assets closed the week with single-digit losses while the rest ended in the green. Of the six assets that had positive returns, two of them clearly dominated this week. 0x Protocol stole the spotlight following the announcement that Coinbase will be leveraging the decentralized exchange infrastructure protocol to power their upcoming NFT marketplace. The 0x token’s price spiked to as high as 55% on the week but has been on a continuous downtrend since reaching the weekly top. It finished the week on the top-performing asset covered with a 26.9% gain. Next up was PancakeSwap, ending the week with a 13.5% return.

Smart Contract Platforms

The smart contract platform sector traded with high synchrony for the entire week with the exception of two assets — TRON (TRX) and Terra (LUNA). While the rest of the assets traded within single-digit range, the two assets broke away from the pack in the second half of the week. After over a 30% drop from its all-time-high, LUNA has managed to bounce back, securing an 11.8% return on the week. On the other hand, the unexpected rally of TRON (TRX) happened after Justin Sun announced that TRON will launch its own native algorithmic stablecoin — USDD. According to the news, it will feature a similar mechanism to UST in order to keep its peg and boast a 30% APY. The TRX token spiked 19% following the news and closed the week with an 18.5% gain.

Currencies

Closely resembling how the smart contract platform sector traded, currencies also traded in close synchrony and within a single-digit channel with the exception of two outliers — privacy coins. The two outperforming currencies this week were Monero (XMR) and Zcash (ZEC). Monero (XMR) broke from the pack mid week and propelled itself to a 21.8% gain on the week. Zcash (ZEC) followed suit but to a lesser extent. It ended the week with a 10.5% return.

Web3

The Web3 sector had a more volatile week compared to the other sectors. Most tokens traded at their own trend, and returns were quite varied with four of the ten assets finishing the week with positive returns. Among those assets, Livepeer was the one to take the lead for the week. The decentralized video infrastructure protocol’s token saw its price finish the week with a 7.6% return. On the other hand, Helium was the laggard of the group as it posted an 11.1% loss for the week.

Gaming

The gaming sector took a last second dip as some of the tokens dropped by as much as 10% in a short period of time. The dip was enough to drag most of the top assets within the sector underwater. Alice (ALICE) was the only one to finish the week on green territory by a small margin (1.4%). Yield Guild Games secured the endmost position of the group as it secured an 11.3% decline for the week.

            <h2>State of Uniswap Q1 Analyst Call Transcript</h2>
            <div class="content">If you would like to view the full recording of the live Crowdfest event, you can find it on our YouTube channel. You can also read the full Quarterly Report by Jerry Sun &lt;a href=&#34;https://messari.io/article/state-of-uniswap-q1-2022&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

Participants:

Jerry Sun - Messari research analyst
Federico Landini - Uniswap Grants Program
Boris Stanic - Uniswap Grants Program
Yj - Uniswap Grants Program

Jerry Sun (0:07): We’re at the top of the hour here, so let’s get started. I think a round of introductions would be welcome. I’m sure many in the Uniswap community know who you guys are, either through discord or the grants program, but I think for anyone on the call who doesn’t, I’m sure that would be helpful. Happy to pass it to you guys first, and then I can go after you guys. Any of you guys want to get us started?

  
Boris Stanic (0:34): I’ll go first. So when we do interviews for the grants program, one of us usually introduces all of us, since we basically all do the same thing but maybe we switch it up for this time. So, my name is Boris, I’m part of the Uniswap Grants Program (UGP) and Uniswap community. For the past almost a year now, its my workaversary or DAOversary soon. What I do is review the grant applications, I host the Uniswap community calls every two weeks, and then we make sure that the grants that we support actually turn out successful – so connecting them with the right people, funding them, trying to break the barriers in front of them, basically. That’s us and myself together, so yea!

  
Jerry Sun (1:42): Nice to have you, Boris!

  
Federico Landini (1:46): I will go, then Yj. Hi everybody, my name is Fede and I’m also part of the Uniswap Grants Program. I was a grantee, I started as a grantee, so I applied to the Uniswap Grants Program to develop a simulator to simulate Uniswap V3 strategies. I got funds and I got involved in the community, and three months ago I joined the team with Yj, Ken and Boris, and we review all together other applications and we follow up grants and help people to develop tools that help the Uniswap community.

  
Yj (2:24): I’m Yj and I’m also one of the reviewers for the Uniswap Grants Program. I first started getting involved with Uniswap staff and helping out with more difficult user tech support on Discord. I also help kind of keep an eye on some other channels, like the international community on the Discord server, for example a Chinese channel, Japanese channel, Indonesian channel. And then about six months ago now, I started helping Boris and Ken, and later on Fede as well, with reviews on grants. Then most recently, Fede and I started the Uniswap grants Community Analytics Program, which we are running right now with data analytics bounties for various topics to encourage the open sharing of crypto and Uniswap analytics for the community, so that’s me.

  
Jerry Sun (3:19): Awesome, welcome everyone! My name is Jerry, I’m a research analyst on the Messari team, I’m based out of San Francisco here, and I wrote the Q1 quarterly report that we’ll be spending some time talking about today. I also wrote the Q4 quarterly report, so I’m fairly familiar with the contents of both reports, and happy to talk about some of the quarter-over-quarter changes that we saw. I think we can get started and dive into the report here. This is where I want to try to share my screen and we’ll see if I’m able to make this work here.

  
Jerry Sun (4:41): So we got the report pulled up, this is the State of Uniswap Q1 2022. I just want to pull this up because one of the things I want to add as a quick disclaimer before we start is that traditionally in our reports, we host them on our website, messari.io, and for the quarterly reports we decided to go and covert all of them to PDF as well. We think that, just in general, PDFs are an easy way for distribution and we want to make sure that everyone in the community has an opportunity to go and read the report, to go and distribute and send to their friends for example. Ethan’s got it pulled up there, and if you guys want to pull it up or check it out, it’s available on the website and I think we have it linked in the chat bar to the right, at the very top. So diving into the report here, I’ve actually got a presentation that I’ve wanted to pull up. We can start with talking a little bit about the macro, so the key metric summary is the table that we’ll want to talk about here. To give a quick overview from a high level of Uniswap and how it performed in Q1, I would say that Q1 was a very different quarter relative to Q4. There we a lot of catalysts for Q4, you think about the rise of NFTs at the beginning of Q4, bitcoin and ether hit all-time highs during that quarter, and all of that activity clearly benefits Uniswap because it encourages a lot of people to go to the DEX to make trades, it encourages trading activity. Q1, in contrast, was a little bit more of a pullback, what I would consider a reversion back to the mean, and so we did see some quarter-over-quarter decreases in total volume, in liquidity, in trading fees, things like that. One important caveat to note, though, is that this is all priced in USD equivalent denominations, so obviously even if the price of bitcoin, ether, and all these crypto tokens is decreasing, that’s going to affect some of the metrics here as well. For you guys on this panel, personally, when you think about Uniswap and the health of the protocol, what are important metrics that you guys look at? What are the best ways to think about how to analyze Uniswap?

  
Federico Landini (8:33): I personally do believe to have a look at the relative performance of Uniswap compared to the other DEXs, so as you say in the last quarter Q1 that the market was quite, not as exciting let’s say as it was in Q4, but if you check the dominance or the performance of Uniswap compared to other AMMs and other DEXs, Uniswap was quite consistently the top DEX also in Q1. I think that’s a good sign of strength and health of the protocol.

  
Boris Stanic (9:13): Maybe I’ll share my thoughts, so trading volumes and numbers don’t really interest that much because it all has to do with how much crypto in general is getting traction and interest among people. As long as I see that projects are launching on top of Uniswap — for example as soon as they launch a token, there’s a Uniswap pool which has a lot of activity and there are also liquidity mining incentives, and they’re using Uniswap for what it was built for — that’s exactly what Uniswap as a protocol needs. It’s being used, and now the volumes at which it’s being used just has to do with the whole cryptocurrency scene and market in general, and you can’t affect it that much as a DEX or as a protocol.

  
Yj (10:18): Yeah, I feel the same way in the sense that one of the things I raised when looking at the reports is that if you talk about volume reducing, we normally use the USD equivalent, so if crypto as a whole drops from one quarter to the next then you expect USD equivalent volume to just drop. So, fair dimension comparing against other DEXs and other protocols is key. The other thing to consider would be comparing against centralized exchanges because it’s all part of price fighting, and Uniswap’s mechanism relies on arbitrage to do the price finding, so when we compare against Coinbase and others, what does that show? Then also another very important thing for V3 especially is, of course, the capital efficiency, concentrated liquidity from the perspective of both liquidity providers in terms of earning fees and also swappers in terms of getting the best execution price, including any fee they’re night need to pay on other protocols or centralized exchanges. Does Uniswap give the best value? I think those are the type of comparative metrics that I personally am most interested in.

  
Jerry Sun (11:36): Right, I think those great points that you make and Yj just to supplement what you’re saying, there’s not a lot Uniswap can do as an individual protocol relative to the broader crypto economy, your metrics are just going to fluctuate just depending on how crypto does in general for the quarter. Just to back that up with some numbers, and Yj pointed this out earlier, that crypto as an entire ecosystem went from $3T in Q4 to $2T at the end of Q1. So that is almost a 50% decrease in terms of how the size of the economy shrank, but when you look at some of these metrics, I think Uniswap actually showed its resiliency because volume only decreased 20%. So what does that mean? It means that if you convert the USD equivalent, Uniswap probably did just as well or maybe even slightly better in Q1 than it did in the previous quarter. There’s probably a continued growth of users, of trades, and I think those are all positive signs. I don’t know if you guys all saw this, but on Twitter, Coinbase announced a bunch of new tokens that they want to list and it’s a lot of stuff that people don’t necessarily know. Some of them people do and a decent number of them people did not know, and that’s something I’ve been thinking about because it seems like they’re trying to compete with Uniswap because it’s so easy to go and list a token on Uniswap. Once you have an airdrop or whatever it’s immediately on there, whereas with Coinbase it’s just so much harder to do that, but they’re trying to list as many tokens as they can. That’s gonna be an advantage that Uniswap will probably have over centralized exchanges. I think you guys made great points and the way you guys think about Uniswap is something I definitely agree with, a very holistic picture.

We can jump now to the next slide, and I want to talk about the growth of Polygon. This is a graph we’ve included in the report, but on the left side of this chart here, you got to see some of the scaling solutions start to take place in terms of liquidity. It’s still very dominated by Ethereum, which is the dark and light blue shading, which represents V2 and V3, but one of the biggest winners of Q1 was Polygon. Their growth was very organic, there weren’t any liquidity mining incentives that went live in Q1, they I believe are live now for the first week of April. When Polygon says they’re going to institute liquidity mining, my question for you guys is does Uniswap or do people in the community have any sort of interaction with the Polygon team? How do people hold them to it to make sure that gets implemented?

  
Boris Stanic (15:42): Maybe I’ll answer this one since I was the most involved. I tweeted out a small thread about 100 days after the proposal passed and there wasn’t too much news about the liquidity mining incentives, but I wasn’t paying enough attention so that’s a mistake on my part. There was actually a developer from Polygon who was updating people but I didn’t follow him so I didn’t see this. Polygon main accounts are just too busy always updating us on the things that are actually launching, so they don’t update people on things they’re working on because they’re constantly launching something. To your question, we do not have a say in how liquidity mining incentives will look on Polygon, it’s completely organized by the Polygon team. As to how we will hold them accountable to make sure these promises are fulfilled, the Polygon team is a highly respectful one and even though it’s not common in crypto, we trusted that they will. There wasn’t a trustless process, so they said there would be up to $15M in liquidity mining incentives and we said, “Yea sure! That sounds good.” If some time passed and if they didn’t do anything, we wouldn’t be able to do anything as well, but I know the other internet research group that’s being supported by the Uniswap Grants Program is actually researching how we can make this trustless. If someone claims that they will do something if a proposal passes, what kind of mechanics can we implement so this becomes a trustless process and it gets executed automatically? Hopefully I didn’t miss any of your questions.

  
Jerry Sun (18:06): No, I think that’s great. In the governance proposal for Polygon, and the way you phrased it as well, you know it’s phrased as “we’re going to give up to $15M of liquidity mining incentives and up to $5M to support the ecosystem around V3 on Polygon.” I saw recently through the live liquidity mining that right now they&#39;ve set aside $3M through a third-party, and what I’m curious about is if that’s what traditionally occurs when they say we’re gonna give “up to 15” but then they set aside $3M? Also, is it common to use a third-party, I think they used Iracus Finance, to go and set that up? Are those things you traditionally see?

  
Boris Stanic (19:07): I think this was the first time in history, at least of Uniswap, that somebody promised something and then liquidity mining incentives happened. I don’t think there’s a usual case for it or am I missing something? Do you have any other examples of this kind of deal happening?

  
Federico Landini (19:41): I don’t think it’s happened in the Uniswap ecosystem, and as Boris was saying, it’s probably an area of improvement where governance has to figure out how to make sure these agreements are followed up on. I think it’s an area that’s interesting, but in this case it was the first time so maybe it was not perfect but in the end it came through.

  
Jerry Sun (20:23): Right, and to summarize here, Polygon has had organic growth even without the liquidity mining. They’ve been the fastest rising in terms of growth relative to time out of the non-Ethereum scaling solutions for V3, so they’ve done a tremendous job.

  
Federico Landrini (20:47): As we said at the beginning, we are running a Uniswap analytics program, and one of the bounties that we published was exactly about the growth of Uniswap on Polygon. We got some really great dashboards from the community that show how fast Uniswap was able to affirm itself on Polygon, and in less than a month it became the biggest DEX on Polygon without liquidity mining incentives. I think this is a very interesting data point that our analyst in the community pointed out.

  
Jerry Sun (21:27): Right, and the Polygon community is just, in general, very big too, so I think there’s a lot of market capture opportunity for Uniswap.

  
Yj (21:39): Yeah, that’s what I was going to say. I think part of this is dependent on how much ERC-20s have already been bridged over from Mainnet to Polygon prior to the Uniswap V3 launch, following the successful governance proposal. The different scaling solutions all went online onto Mainnet at different times, and then on each of them, they are different major and maybe chain-exclusive projects that launch on them. Some of them, like Polygon, I haven’t really looked into the data yet and maybe this is one analysis that would be interesting to look at, but they might have already had a lot of projects and tokens being bridged over or launched natively or exclusively for Polygon. So when Uniswap is there, there’s a lot more tokens available for liquidity and swapping. That’s maybe a gut feeling on my end, since I haven’t looked at the data. Then in terms of the liquidity mining promise, it’s going to be very difficult as a community and grants program to encourage more trustless tooling and processes to make everything smoother and better. But if you think about it, when the Polygon governance proposal was put out, there was never any cross-chain governance process or tooling at all, so it had to be a trust-based thing. When they, “we will launch on Polygon,” at the time, Uniswap Labs had to work with them to launch it and put in the rails to make sure everything works. Since then, things have been happening and UGP actually funded GFX Labs to start researching cross-chain governance for Uniswap, and that resulted in a successful test case activation of one of the basis point pools on Polygon, just a few days ago. Hoping that as a grants program, we can encourage more and more of this type of research and tooling development to make things move towards full trustlessness.

  
Boris Stanic (24:05): Can I just share one thing when it comes to L2 solutions that I think might be important?

  
Jerry Sun (24:13): Yeah, absolutely.

  
Boris Stanic (24:15): So we have a graph here of liquidity and I don&#39;t think that liquidity and volume, in terms of numbers, is as important as a number of unique addresses that interacted on the certain L2 solution. Big whales and big traders will always prefer the security of a main chain and liquidity of a main chain over trusting some L2 solution because the safest chain is the Ethereum chain. But what happens on the main chain is that smaller traders get priced out by gas and here is where L2 solutions come into play and they make it so that you can still do trustless swaps in a fully decentralized way, well not fully but as far as it currently goes. It just opens the door for smaller traders to enter the scene and invest in the tokens and swap tokens that they like, so that&#39;s what&#39;s one point that I want to share.

  
Jerry Sun (25:32): Right, I think that&#39;s a great point. I guess Boris, to add on to what you&#39;re saying, one reason why, in my opinion, Polygon has really taken off is that it’s just seen as a side chain. It&#39;s very easy to bridge between Polygon and Ethereum, but you go to something like Optimism, optimistic L2 rollups, and it&#39;s a little bit more difficult to move money back and forth, in terms of waiting periods and things like that. So I assume that when zk-rollups become live or you can launch smart contracts on zk-rollups, the governance community at Uniswap are probably gonna go and try to set that up as well, and we&#39;ll probably see some good organic growth from there too because again, like you said, there’s cheaper costs but you don&#39;t have to worry about some of the the difficulties with using the optimistic rollups in that sense.

  
Boris Stanic (26:34): Yeah, definitely. The L2 scene is still developing and people put a lot of hope into zk-rollups to make it even better, but we&#39;ll have to wait and see. Ethereum as a chain is also progressing and will be able to sustain more transactions per second and the combination of these two things might make it so that we don&#39;t ever see $300 fees on Uniswap ever again. It will be something that we will tell kids about, you know, so the whole scene is just making it so that it can sustain higher throughput in a sustainable way, so not jeopardizing decentralization and security too much. That will enable lower fees, which will enable more people to actually use Uniswap as a dapp on those chains.

  
Jerry Sun (27:52): Right, right. Yj you mentioned something that I thought was pretty interesting, which is the cross-chain governance proposal that&#39;s going on right now with Polygon. I talk about it in the report, but extremely successful, and I think a very good example of governance coming together and coming up with something that is really beneficial to everyone; to LPs, to people who want to make swaps on Uniswap. I think since its creation it’s generated like $2.5M to $3M of fees for LPs, so that’s a big win for everyone. I guess I&#39;m kind of curious to hear your thought on this, because in terms of cross-chain governance, this is the first example of cross-chain governance, but in the future how do you envision cross-chain governance to play out? Do you think, “right now it&#39;s live on Ethereum and then gets implemented on Polygon,” do you think that will continue to be the case? Do you guys think it might be the other way around, where maybe you test something on Polygon if there&#39;s a little less activity you see if it works, and then you try it on Ethereum? Assuming cross-chain governance works, what are your takes on that?

  
Yj (29:15): I think it&#39;s hard to say. It&#39;s still developing, it&#39;s so new. And just in governance in general, even voting mechanisms, are being changed all the time by different projects and people are still experimenting on it. The thing with Uniswap governance and the Uniswap protocol as a whole is the immutable nature of it. So as it stands now, that has been deployed without further governance proposals that get passed and executed. There is no simple way of doing more complex cross-chain stuff, so the Polygon one has to necessarily go from Mainnet onto Polygon because the $UNI token where voting power lies is on Mainnet Unisawap, right. And actually, in the previous community call that Boris hosted, we also quickly discussed this in terms of governance, the fact that $UNI token actually loses its voting power if it&#39;s bridged to other side chains or L2s, if you put it in LP, if you put it on lending protocol. We actually have a current live data bounty program asking the community to contribute to this, and to look into the extent of loss of $UNI voting power when you utilize it for other things. But going back to your original question, you were saying whether I personally see experimentation being done on L2s or chains before moving back, I mean as it stands that cannot happen, but that&#39;s not to say that it will not happen. I&#39;m personally quite excited to see what people come up with to experiment on this, and actually Uniswap Grants Program is looking for people to submit applications to research and maybe prototype or test or experiment with all these. I think it will be pretty exciting to see, and of course with Uniswap continuing to get deployed on other chains, stuff like cross-chain processing mechanism will become more and more important, so I&#39;m personally quite looking forward to seeing the new stuff that can come up from there.

  
Jerry Sun (31:31): Right, definitely. Well, you know, you bring up the grants program, and you guys are exploring a lot of different ways to do some studies on how you can do governance with the $UNI token on other chains, and just other initiatives in general for the grants program. I want to talk about the grants program a little bit here, this is obviously your bread and butter, seeing all these proposals. The first question I have is a fun one for myself which is, when I go and DM the Uniswap Grants Program Twitter handle, which one of you guys is responding to me?

  
Boris Stanic (32:15): None of us, I think. We have a shadow writer.

  
Jerry Sun (32:24): Well whoever that person is, I just wanted to say how very friendly and very helpful, so thank you. Thank that person, whoever it is.

  
Boris Stanic (32:35): I mean, I think you can deduce who it is. It’s nobody in this chat.

  
Jerry Sun (32:41): Right, of course. Well tell us a little about the grants program, how are decisions made in the grants program? In terms of deciding what projects or proposals get funded, is it a group decision? Do you guys each look at proposals individually? What is the structure of that?

  
Yj (33:11): Boris you undertake this one?

  
Boris Stanic (33:14): Okay I&#39;ll do it since I think I’ve spent the longest period of time as part of the grants program. Essentially, it is a group decision and a key question that we always ask ourselves when we look at the applications is: does this fall into the grand program scope? So the program was established by the governance to fund public goods and promote the protocol in the ecosystem, but promoting doesn&#39;t really mean marketing, at least that&#39;s what we believe. So when you look at the public goods, one key question that we ask ourselves and look for in the application is: will this happen if we don&#39;t intervene? So let&#39;s say somebody is making a for-profit project, and then a small part of that for-profit project touches Uniswap, and they would like us to fund development of the project for that part which touches Uniswap. The answer to the question, “will it happen if we don&#39;t fund it?” is yes because they&#39;re building a whole project also and this key part will also be part of it. But on the other side, we have different SDKs, libraries, and things that wouldn&#39;t really exist or, even better, wouldn&#39;t exist in a humane way, because somebody would spend hours and hours developing it and making it great for the others to use and wouldn&#39;t get any kind of compensation for it. That’s when we step in with our connections, so grantees have questions and we make sure that they get answers, and we also support them financially so that they don&#39;t work on these things for free. We have a small process, we do weekly sprints where we have two ongoing sprints at the same time, so we do interviews and then we do you know discussions and internal reviews. These are two separate sprints where, if the previous week was interviews, the current week is discussions, and we try to find more information if we need it. Then for the interviews, we just do the interviews and take notes so we can discuss it and do more research the next week. I think since Fede and Yj joined we’ve had the just right amount of reviewers and people to not have an expanding backlog like we had before, so I think we&#39;re pretty up to date right now. But it&#39;s always a discussion and our working group trusts each other, so maybe if I personally don&#39;t see value in some proposal but Fede or Yj think that it&#39;s really good for the ecosystem, I will trust their call. Of course we are not perfect, we make mistakes and we try to correct those as well through some of the other grants that we do, such as Gitcoin, where we actually let the community decide how funds will be distributed. Hopefully that  answers your question.

  
Jerry Sun (37:45): Right, definitely. This is not the most direct comparison, I know there&#39;s some differences, but I think the grants program almost like you guys are investors and you&#39;re making investments not for for-profit businesses per se, and you&#39;re not looking for a direct financial return, but rather to grow the ecosystem to benefit the Uniswap protocol and the crypto community as a whole. So when investors give money to a project, typically they also get updates maybe once a month or once a quarter, as they want to know how their investment is doing, what have you guys done with this funding, and things like that. I know there&#39;s not always follow-ups in terms of governance, but with the grants program, if I want to come to you with a project for $25,000 and then you guys approve it, what goes after the approval process? Do you have check-ins with the proposer?

  
Boris Stanic (38:57): Somebody else should answer this, but yes, so maybe Yj they or Fede since you know the process.

  
Federico Landrini (39:03): Yes, we have continuous checks, monthly or bi-monthly depending on the project, to check the the status and to try to help the grantee as much as possible with our connection to the Uniswap Labs team or to other resources from other projects. As I shared at the beginning, I was a grantee myself so I went through this process and this is what made me more and more involved in the community, and at the end, ended up part of the grants program team itself. It&#39;s also an opportunity for the grantees to be involved more, to participate in hackathons, in presentations, really it&#39;s not only that they need to work on their project but it&#39;s being part of the community and helping each other to be successful in the end.

  
Yj (39:53): Yeah, I think the distinction between VC investors and the grants program is an important one, in the sense that when we accept a grant application, we will ask for a sensible timeline and what the plan is. Then we put in sensible milestones for those check-ins and they don&#39;t have to be super straight in terms of deadlines or timing, but if we don&#39;t hear something back from a grantee, the main worry is that they are facing blockers that they cannot surpass. We are here to encourage people to work together in open-source ways and create public goods for the Uniswap ecosystem. So the worry is not so much about people running away with $5,000 or something, it&#39;s more about if there is something blocking you from achieving the aims of the grant that you applied for. So the check-in plays a role in that sense, to see how we can help, because as Fede said, they might need some input from the Labs team, they might need input from from other people within crypto, so we try to make those connections for them in order to maximize the return from grants. And, you know, Uniswap Grants Program was given a mandate to do so by community governance, so that&#39;s a bit of a difference.

  
Jerry Sun (41:26): Right, that makes sense. From you all’s perspective, what are some of the biggest challenges that you guys face when you go through proposals, when you accept proposals, and just managing the grants program? I&#39;ve heard from people who are part of grants programs, and they always say it’s a very time consuming job, it&#39;s a very extensive role. And you know, Fede, from what you&#39;re saying it sounds like you guys have check-ins, and if you guys have check-ins with I don&#39;t know how many grants you guys approve every week, I assume it&#39;s you know one or two or several maybe a week, that&#39;s a decent number of check-ins that you kind of continuously have to do every month or every two months. I&#39;m just kind of curious, from your perspective, what are some of the blockers on your end if you guys have any?

  
Federico Landrini (42:28): Personally, I think the broadness of the space and the knowledge that you have to have to to judge some of the projects is the most difficult part for us, because as you know, crypto is a very very technical space, and we move from development to tokeneconomics to governance to analytics, so there is a very broad surface that we try to cover as much as possible, and when we cannot do it, we try to to get help in the community to get the knowledge that is required to understand the proposal.

  
Jerry Sun (43:22): Gotcha. Do you guys have any sort of funding minimum or maximum for any of the proposals? I know that these are kind of arbitrary, these waves, they don&#39;t really correlate to any specific period of time, you just kind of batch them together. However, wave six is noticeably higher in terms of the funding than in previous waves, and a big part of that is due to the other internet funding. I think that was very significant, but just in terms of how much you&#39;re able to give, are there any sort of restrictions on your end?

  
Boris Stanic (44:07): There are no restrictions really, well other internet grant was really big, but it&#39;s actually delegated funding, so they will use those funds to fund more grants and research and different people, so it&#39;s not just a team where five or six of them get the whole million dollars. It will actually be sort of like a subDAO or committee, but they do great things in the research, so that&#39;s why we decided to support them. When we talk about minimums and maximums, there are no such things, but you’re right, wave eight already exists but it wasn&#39;t announced so it&#39;s just an arbitrary amount of applications that we you know cut and then you say, “okay this is a wave.” Also some things that you&#39;ll probably see in the wave eight that we started doing recently are smaller grants, and we&#39;re open to having a smaller part especially when it comes to different events in different parts of the world and different communities. So for spoilers, in the wave eight you will see a lot of smaller grants that are targeting different events and communities across the world, and we think that that&#39;s a great way of just spreading the word of Uniswap and also helping these communities grow because, let&#39;s say $5,000 to some community event that is not in the most expensive part of the world will encourage more people than you would otherwise get. You will have a greater impact than spending $20,000 or $30,000 on a San Francisco event, so we are more open to sponsoring these smaller grants recently. Maybe something to add Yj?

  
Yj (46:41): Yeah, I was going to say that in terms of the amounts, at the end of the day, the grants program is somewhat a reactive process, so we do not prescribe or dictate how grant applications should be. It’s somewhat reactive and organic in the sense that it might just happen that during wave six, for whatever reason, a lot of people happen to prepare their grants application and submit their model at the same time, and then the ones that were deemed fundable just all added up right. Then, what Boris was saying about the spoiler alert for wave eight, we don&#39;t know why, but wave eight actually had quite a few more event sponsorship-type grant applications that came in of different sizes, and we made the decision to fund them because we see value in them. So that&#39;s why some funds, some waves, given that arbitrary like drawing of timing, can be big or small or can be anything really. But one one thing to note would be that we avoid funding things that are just purely an idea with no work done yet, like if someone comes in and say, “I have this grand idea but I haven&#39;t done anything about it, I need money to do it,” we try to avoid doing that normally. Our thinking, and I think we&#39;re in alignment, is that grants funding should be mostly for things that people already put some thought and effort into, already pursued, and have some minimal progress to show. So that also influences our decision-making process.

  
Jerry Sun (48:24): Right, you guys want to see a minimum viable product, I guess.

  
Boris Stanic (48:30): It’s not really that we demand, it&#39;s just the necessity because we are a small grant program in terms of people who are part of it, and we don&#39;t have enough manpower to get the whole project off the ground because that&#39;s the hardest part, getting it off the ground. We are here more to help you get from the current stage of your project to the next stage of your project, but getting the whole thing off the ground is currently too much for us. Maybe sometime in the future if we grow in numbers and manpower, we will be able to support such ideas, but right now it&#39;s more about getting the projects to the next level.

  
Jerry Sun (49:24): Right, right. Some of the things that you said in your earlier answer, Boris, about funding events in some smaller places, I think that&#39;s a really great idea. You&#39;re really stretching the value of the funding in a lot of ways, and I assume some will be similar to Art Basel and we have it on the screen here as one of the things that you guys funded previously or funded last year but, uh I think that funding went to setting up a booth right to onboard people into crypto. Is that a similar goal that you guys are hoping to achieve with these funds for the smaller events?

  
Boris Stanic (50:10): For the smaller events, when we think about it, it&#39;s not as much about Uniswap as it is about onboarding people to the cryptocurrency space and blockchain space in general. So we want to support people getting into the community of blockchain in general, and then eventually they will stumble upon Uniswap almost for sure, which is great for us. So yeah, we want to support these communities to grow and eventually they will reach Uniswap as well. And yeah, a similar case with Art Basel, we thought that there will be a lot of people there that have interest in cryptocurrencies, but maybe didn&#39;t have anybody you know to onboard them to the space, so we thought it&#39;d be a great idea for us as a grant program to support that.

  
Jerry Sun (51:26): Right, gotcha. That makes a ton of sense. I&#39;m really excited to kind of see the grants that get released in wave eight. You gave a little spoiler here, but curious to see what things got funded. If we move to the governance section, I know we got a couple minutes here at the very end, and I know there are some questions that we&#39;ll get to from the community, but if we go to the next page in this deck, the last page in this deck, I’ve got a list of some major governance updates from this past quarter. It&#39;s a little bit small here, but one of the things I really want to talk about and get your personal opinions on is the fee switch. This fee switch is something that everyone talks about, it&#39;s very famous in the crypto community, and I think for this particular proposal, it got rejected because it sounds like people wanted to go and set up a research group to understand how to best set up the fee switch or how to best turn on the fee switch. In your personal opinions, when do you think the fee switch should be turned on, if ever, and how should it be done if that time does come?

  
Boris Stanic (52:55): Yj maybe you take this one, I know you have a lot of opinions about the research.

  
Yj (53:02): Sorry I was just typing answers in the chat. I think the fact that no consensus has been forthcoming kind of just says it all. We have people asking about and proposing it and and talking about it, but it never really got enough traction as far as I can see, so in terms of the incentive, if you have fee switch then the community treasury will get the fee, so it gets fed back to the community treasury which is also controlled by $UNI token holders with delegated voting rights. So if overall, the dedicated voting power collectively feels that fee switching is a good thing, then I would imagine you go ahead and at least progress a bit further. My personal opinion right now is that nothing is happening yet, maybe there&#39;s no real need for it yet, but it can happen anytime, so we should continue conversations and have debates about this. If possible, we should get some data-backed opinions or commentary on it to see what to do next, so that&#39;s what I think.

  
Jerry Sun (54:45): But do you think the fee switch will ever happen? Because, in theory, there is a potential future where you have this fee switch and it just never gets turned on, because the way the current system is, LPs get a lot of fees and it works for them and then Uniswap as a protocol provides a service, they don&#39;t necessarily earn protocol revenue that goes to the community. I don&#39;t know if you guys think it will ever happen or not?

  
Federico Landrini (55:19): It’s a good question and I don&#39;t think there is an answer. It&#39;s very difficult to forecast what will happen. For me personally, the important part is the health of the protocol and the growth of the protocol, and then I think that when the community is ready and we know what we want to do, we can find a solution. The important thing is to have a LP protocol, and then once we decide to switch or another governance decision that improves the tokeneconomics of you of the $UNI token, it could work. So for me, the key thing at the moment is to really focus on the health of the protocol, as you showed your report.

  
Jerry Sun (56:04): Right, right. I think that makes a lot of sense. We have a couple of questions from the community here, so I think we could spend the last couple of minutes answering those. The first question I notice is, “please tell us quarterly volume of centralized exchanges like Binance and Coinbase, so we can compare how they are doing with Uniswap.” To my knowledge, I think Coinbase processed about $525B worth of trades in the quarter and I think the previous quarter was around like $330B or so. For them, it was an increase, but compared to Uniswap, if you look at the quarters, I think Uniswap processed about $180B. So the values you&#39;re looking at are $180B and $525B. Uniswap is processing about a third of the transaction volume of Coinbase, but Coinbase is seen as a traditional fiat on-ramp for a lot of people. Institutions are also heavily active on a lot of centralized exchanges, so it&#39;s not a direct apples-to-apples kind of comparison in that sense, but I think to say that Uniswap is processing a third of the transaction volume of a company like Coinbase is no small feat, in my personal opinion. Another question I’ve got is, “the purpose of Uniswap grants is to encourage development of projects built on top of  the Uniswap protocol or something else?”

  
Boris Stanic (58:00): It’s to grow the Uniswap protocol and its ecosystem, so we encourage development on top of Uniswap. We believe if we make it streamlined, easier, better documentation, more resources supporting more programming languages and make that whole process more enjoyable, that is how we encourage development on top of Uniswap. Finding strategic partnerships and things like that is out of scope for the grants program, so we are here so that once you decide to build on top of Uniswap, you have the best time of your life. But making you and giving you a reason to do so, that&#39;s more for that particular team or a person to decide on.

  
Jerry Sun (59:02): Right, got it. This last question we have from the community is: these governance proposals seem fixated on extending Uniswap to other fledging protocols. This is worrisome. Who is focusing on making the core product better and easier to use? This comes from John. I can answer this one as well. We&#39;re talking about the uniswap grants program, and that&#39;s separate from Uniswap Labs. Uniswap Labs is doing a lot of the development of the protocol they&#39;ve got the engineers who are working on the protocol. The grants program is a portion of the funding from the treasury and their mandate is to essentially, like Boris was saying, build the Uniswap ecosystem and spread awareness on the crypto economy as a whole, so completely separate. I&#39;m sure the people at Uniswap are definitely working on improving the product, and I think we are at time here so we can just about wrap up. John&#39;s question is actually very related to my final question which is: you guys are a little bit closer to what&#39;s going on with Uniswap than many of us on the call, so I wanted to just quickly ask if you have any alpha or any insights into what Uniswap V4 might look like. I think we&#39;re all kind of curious.

  
Yj (1:00:35): I don&#39;t have anything. I actually don&#39;t. I have no idea and that&#39;s why we were saying the other day, remember that the grants program is completely separate from Uniswap Labs, so I don&#39;t know, maybe Boris has some alpha.

  
Boris Stanic (1:00:53): To be honest, the first time I heard about V4 was yesterday when they were discussing some applications and somebody said, “this will help in researching the V4,” and so that&#39;s as much as I know about the V4. Did somebody say there will be a V4?

  
Jerry Sun (1:01:17): I assume there will be, that&#39;s kind of my assumption.

  
Boris Stanic (1:01:21): Okay, this is just my personal opinion of what Uniswap V4 might be. So Uniswap V4, in my opinion, will be a Uniswap that combines all the different deployments. You&#39;ll have a single interface, you&#39;ll select which token you want to swap to which token, and it will execute on some chain where you will get optimal fees, slippage, price and execution time. You won&#39;t even know where it executed, but the tokens that you wanted will end up in your wallet and that will actually be the V4. We, as a governance, deploying Uniswap V3 on all these different chains, scaling solutions side chains whatever, is the path to V4, but as I said, this is just my opinion of what V4 might be.

  
Jerry Sun (1:02:29): All right. Fede, Yj, do you guys want to make any predictions?

  
Federico Landrini (1:02:33): No, no predictions. I like the vision of Boris, but it&#39;s just a wish at the moment. We really don&#39;t have any kind of insight on a roadmap or anything like that.

  
Jerry Sun (1:02:47): Got it. Alrighty, well we are kind of past the hour here. I appreciate you guys all hopping on, this is a really enjoyable experience and I enjoyed getting to chat about the health of the protocol, what you guys are doing on the grants program, and some of these roadmap and governance updates that are currently ongoing. Thanks everyone for tuning in, the audience and to the three of you guys, and wish you guys a good rest of the day.</div>

            <h2>Weekly Recap Ending April 14</h2>
            <div class="content">Notable Messari Intel Updates

Circle Internet Financial, the issuer of USDC, announced that it has agreed to &lt;a href=&#34;https://messari.io/intel/event/d563a1c1-091d-4ab8-b635-c09d90cc7108&#34;&gt;raise $400 million&lt;/a&gt; from BlackRock, Fidelity Management and Research, Marshall Wace LLP, and Fin Capital in a funding round expected to close in Q2 2022. In addition to the strategic investment, BlackRock has entered into a broader strategic partnership with Circle to explore capital market applications for USDC, among other use cases.
The Acala team has announced that they are working to &lt;a href=&#34;https://messari.io/intel/event/bb4c9eb9-111d-43ad-9652-97e6a380c2a6&#34;&gt;integrate LDOT and LKSM, Acala and Karura&#39;s yield-bearing staking derivatives, as collateral assets on Anchor&lt;/a&gt;. The teams will also work together to establish deep liquidity pools for aUSD and UST on Acala to serve as a gateway into the Polkadot ecosystem for UST users.
Uniswap has announced the &lt;a href=&#34;https://messari.io/intel/event/64e86352-7962-43e8-a53a-cc4a4f1c2624&#34;&gt;launch of Uniswap Labs Ventures&lt;/a&gt;. The announcement said that “Uniswap Labs Ventures will invest in teams at different stages and levels of the Web3 stack, from infrastructure to developer tools and consumer-facing applications.”
The Yearn Finance Team, via Twitter, &lt;a href=&#34;https://messari.io/intel/event/033c55a4-5b5d-4c24-b917-9345b008b771&#34;&gt;endorsed the adoption of the ERC-4626 token type&lt;/a&gt;, a new standard for tokenized Vaults and yield-bearing tokens. The team stated, &#34;In a word, ERC-4626 will be the gold standard for any sort of interest-bearing token… from Yearn Vaults to AAVE deposits and Balancer linear pools.&#34; Currently, contributors are working to implement the ERC - 4626 standard for Yearn V3 Vaults with no stated timeline for completion.  

Notable Messari Governor Updates

BitDAO has &lt;a href=&#34;https://messari.io/governor/proposal/bbbd0865-5cd5-4cf6-a20a-a8cca766d92e&#34;&gt;submitted a proposal&lt;/a&gt; that aims to approve a partnership between BitDAO and PleasrDAO in which BitDAO will invest $6.5 million (95% ETH/USDT and 5% in BIT). PleasrDAO is a collector DAO that buys and funds culturally significant digital art pieces. The partnership will diversify BitDAO&#39;s investment into art/NFTs. Voting is currently active.
After the Balancer team discovered that the current gauge system does not perform as intended in the original veBAL tokenomics proposal, the Balancer DAO &lt;a href=&#34;https://messari.io/governor/proposal/acadec86-d86f-436e-97ff-46dcff998e3f&#34;&gt;submitted a proposal&lt;/a&gt; that aims to determine whether the Balancer community prefers to deploy a new veBAL gauge system or use the current gauge system. Voting will start tomorrow.
The Idle DAO &lt;a href=&#34;https://messari.io/governor/proposal/cc9d69ae-c1cc-4d17-93ee-a0d016a56b5f&#34;&gt;succeeded&lt;/a&gt; in passing a proposal that aims to initiate the process of enabling external contracts to integrate with the stkIDLE module. The current whitelisting process has resulted in multiple whitelisting proposals being halted due to failed voting sessions. The new approach would implement the SmartWalletWhitelist contract to manage all contracts interacting with the staking module.
The Balancer DAO &lt;a href=&#34;https://messari.io/governor/proposal/cdbd21d2-4ee9-4c0e-8d2e-2bfe97a3f210&#34;&gt;succeeded&lt;/a&gt; in passing a proposal that aims to authorize Bancor 3 Beta Release to observe an operational deployment of the system in a limited capacity. The Beta release will run for 28 days concurrently with a $30 million BNT rewards program (13,043,478 BNT) and a $1 million bug bounty supported by the Bancor Foundation.
The DODO DAO &lt;a href=&#34;https://messari.io/governor/proposal/2ced1bfa-4f12-4168-822d-7e6af3245e3f&#34;&gt;failed&lt;/a&gt; to pass a proposal aimed to solve the issues of multichain voting rights and low voter turnout for the DODO governance. To solve the multichain voting rights, it seeked to approve creating a new governance framework for use in place of Snapshot. The new voting system would be similar to Snapshot, using an off-chain signature collection and a decentralized storage system to count votes. However, it would account for DODO held in multiple chains when assigning voting power to users, unlike the current strategy that only accounts for DODO on Ethereum.

Sector Returns

The crypto market has tumbled again, marking the second week in a row where all sectors covered return drawdowns. Four of the six sectors covered returned double digit-losses, with Web3 being the biggest loser. The Web3 sector has been among the hardest hit during the recent weeks — this week losing 12.57%. Gaming also had a rough week, trading places with Web3 as the sector with the biggest decline most recently. It returned -11.41% on the week.

Top Assets

Dogecoin (DOGE) has continued to hold its ground. It was the only asset within the top 10 assets by market capitalization that made it above water last week, and this week, it declined the least. This week, the original dog coin only lost 1.4% in value. Contrast this to Terra (LUNA) which was the laggard of the group and ended the week with a 21.4% decline.

DeFi Assets

All top DeFi assets by market capitalization ended the week in the red with the exception of one — Loopring (LRC). The zkRollup-based Layer-2 platform’s asset saw its price gain 5.8% on the week, while the broader DeFi ecosystem suffered losses. Aside from the one outlier, more than half of the DeFi assets saw double-digit losses. Anchor (ANC), after being the top-performing DeFi asset for last week, gave all of its gains back and now finds itself more than 65% down from all-time-high. The Terra-based lending and borrowing platform saw its token end the week with a 13.5% loss. Impressively, although most DeFi assets are far away from all-time-high territory, DeFi TVL has remained on relatively healthy levels, currently sitting at $159.39 billion.

Smart Contract Platforms

All top smart contract platform tokens ended the week in negative territory, with 7 of the top 10 assets by market capitalization seeing double-digit negative returns. NEAR protocol started the week on a high note, gaining 12% in value but then giving it all back and joining the rest of the sector performance wise. The Proof-of-Stake-based blockchain token managed to secure the number one spot for the week by a small margin, having the smallest decline (-5.3%). Terra (LUNA) was the laggard of the group, ending the week with a 21.9% decline.

Currencies

Only two currencies ended the week in green territory, with Monero (XMR) leading the pack and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) taking the second spot. XMR traded above positive territory for most of the week, which was enough to help the privacy-focused coin secure the first spot with a moderate 2.2% gain. Bitcoin Cash on the other hand slumped mid-week with the rest of the sector but was able to recover the 10% loss in order to secure its second place with a 0.7% gain. Zcash had the largest decline within the top currencies by market capitalization, ending the week with a -17.1% return.

Web3

The worst performing sector of the week saw six of its top ten assets end the week with losses in the double-digits. Interestingly the biggest losers were among the highest by market capitalization within the sector. The asset that declined the least within the category was Audius (AUDIO), returning -5.9% on the week. Filecoin (FIL) secured the endmost position of the group with a 15.8% decline.

Gaming

Gaming was the second worst performing sector of the week, with losses ranging from -4.5% to -15.5% and half of the top assets returning double-digit losses. Aavegotchi (GHST) is one of the less volatile assets within the gaming ecosystem and sustained the least drawdown for the week with a 4.5% decline. Yield Guild Games (YGG) held the rear position this week with a 15.5% loss.

Introduction to Compound

Launched in September 2018, Compound is a leading interest rate protocol built on Ethereum that enables users to permissionlessly borrow and lend assets from a pool of collateral. It sets interest rates for those assets algorithmically using an interest rate model based on the proportion of assets lent out, which it calls the utilization ratio. Compound launched its V2 protocol in May 2019, which introduced additional assets, individual risk models, and smart contract gateways for each asset, among other features. In April 2020, Compound replaced the administrator of the protocol with community governance, empowering COMP token holders to take control of the protocol. In June 2020, Compound &lt;a href=&#34;https://messari.io/article/the-agricultural-revolution-of-defi-is-underway?referrer=grid-view&#34;&gt;began distributing&lt;/a&gt; COMP to users via a pioneering liquidity mining program reserving 42% of the total COMP supply to be distributed to users over the next four years.

Compound KPIs across the board were largely down due to market volatility, decreasing overall loan appetite and applying supply pressure. Outstanding loans and deposits fell 42% and 32%, respectively, while liquidations skyrocketed 295% in Q1. Governance facilitated a few key changes to the protocol, including collateral factor adjustments, updating the price oracle, reducing COMP proposal thresholds, and reducing COMP rewards by 50%.

Compound Markets – Macro Overview

As Q1 2022 wrapped up, many key performance indicators for Compound experienced substantial declines. The quarter ended with a 42% decline in outstanding loans, a 32% decline in outstanding deposits, a 53% decline in originations, which was already down 32% in the prior quarter, and an astounding 79% decline in deposits. Quarterly deposits hit an all-time-low in the trailing twelve months (TTM). Q1’s only growth area was in liquidations with a monstrous 295% increase, totaling $134 million, largely driven by market volatility towards the end of January.

Unsurprisingly, the slashing of KPIs across the board had a material impact on protocol financials. Net income, which was up 12% in the prior quarter, fell by 48%, totaling $4.9 million in the quarter.

Last quarter was catalyzed by the total crypto market cap experiencing all-time-highs of $2.97 trillion. After an overheated end of 2021, the market cooled off and shaved over 40% in value, ending January with approximately $1.68 trillion in total market cap.

Outstanding loans were down 42% in the quarter, dropping to levels seen back in Q1 2021, when the total crypto market cap also had a cooling period. Loans in stablecoins denominated in USDC and DAI continued to outpace loans denominated in other assets. DAI maintained its market share of overall loans outstanding on Compound as Q1 2022 ended.

Borrower interest rates were relatively stable compared to the prior quarter. The average annualized interest rate was 3.85%, down from 5.02% in Q4. Rates decreased as users’ demand for leverage decreased as the market cooled off in Q1. Additionally, the COMP distribution bug in Q4, resulted in assets leaving the protocol, which impacted supply and drove rates higher. Borrower interest rates maxed out at 4.48% as the market hit YTD lows.

Outstanding deposits were down 32% in Q1 with the steepest decline transitioning into February. Similar to outstanding loan volumes, deposits approached TTM lows seen in Q2 2021. Deposit volumes rose in March with depositors continuing to prefer WETH.

Depositor interest rates were down but stable over the quarter. This can be attributed to deposits consistently matching borrower demand. The average quarterly depositor interest rate was 1.51%, down from 2.04% in Q4. Annualized interest rates hit a low of 1.19% in Q1 and peaked at 1.87%. Interest rates saw their steepest decline at the end of January due to market volatility.

Compound’s aggregate utilization ratio remained relatively flat at the onset of 2022 but gradually weakened as the crypto market experienced turbulence rolling into February. Outstanding deposits declined at a slower rate of 32% relative to 42% for outstanding loans, which contributed to the utilization ratio revisiting its lows back in Q3 and Q4 2021.

Interest income for the quarter deteriorated by 54% compared to Q4 2021. Coincidentally, interest and protocol income virtually experienced the same percentage changes in Q1. USDC dropped the furthest, falling 62%, followed by USDT and WBTC declining 50.8% and 50.7%, respectively. Quarterly interest income was impacted because market volatility decreased loan appetite.

Protocol income was halved, dropping from $10 million in Q4 2021 to slightly under $5 million in Q1. DAI, which is responsible for over 60% of protocol income in Q1, was down 47% quarter-over-quarter.

The narrative continues across originations (new loans) for Q1. Total originations were down 53% in the quarter, led by DAI with a $2.9 billion drop (66%), over the quarter. USDC and USDT held strong but still had large declines of 48% and 47%, respectively. USDC continued to show dominance in origination volume from the prior quarter. WBTC was the only asset that grew in originations over the quarter, resulting in a 17% increase or $1.7 million.

New quarterly deposit volume took a nosedive in Q1, falling from $63 billion to $13 billion, or 79%. DAI quarterly deposits plunged by over 90%, from $44 billion to $4 billion in Q1. Compared to DAI, WBTC fell a modest 18% in deposit volume in the quarter. On-chain data suggests a user was using flash loans to arbitrage between AAVE and Compound in December 2021, driving quarterly deposits up 587%. Subsequently, another market-maker pulled DAI off the protocol in Q1, contributing to the spike in deposit volume quarter-over-quarter.

DAI, WETH, and USDC are now in contention for overall quarterly deposits on Compound, with $4 million, $3.6 million, and $3.5 million in deposits, respectively. USDC was able to close the gap on WETH deposit volume in Q1, relative to the prior quarter.

Liquidations on Compound peaked towards the end of January, growing 295% quarter-over-quarter. This activity was largely due to liquidations across the WETH and USDC markets resulting in increases of 270% and 665%, respectively. WETH liquidations grew from $14 million in Q4 to $106 million in Q1, largely due to ETH volatility experienced in late January. USDC markets experienced a $13 million increase in liquidations over the quarter while DAI liquidation volume was virtually non-existent in Q1 relative to the prior quarter of $3 million.

COMP token incentives fell drastically by 52% in Q1. These incentives are a key driver of depositor and borrower activity. Governance passed a proposal at the end of Q1 that would reduce COMP incentives by 50% with plans to eliminate incentive rewards. Given these plans, there should be a rapid decline in COMP token incentives in Q2.

Compound’s Five Largest Markets - Micro Overview

Compound markets experienced various modifications in the quarter through governance. Gauntlet facilitated collateral factor adjustments across eight markets, GFX Labs introduced an updated price oracle, and a new algorithmic stablecoin market, FEI, was added to the protocol. Continuing last quarter’s trend, borrowers continued to favor loans in stable assets over others.

Although key performance indicators across the board were down in Q1, DAI continued to be the prevailing market on Compound, leading in metrics like loans outstanding, deposit volume, interest income, and protocol revenue. DAI loans outstanding decreased 47%, from $3.4 billion to $1.5 billion, while DAI’s outstanding deposits decreased at a slightly higher rate of 49%, from $3.4 billion to $1.75 billion. Expectedly, quarterly originations were down 66%, from $4.4 billion to $1.5 billion. Liquidations in DAI were virtually non-existent in the quarter.

Average annualized interest rates were down from 4.5% in Q4, to 4.12% in Q1. Borrower interest rates hit a low of 3.58% and peaked at 5.10% in the quarter. The utilization ratio increased by 3.24% in Q1, resulting in borrower interest rate volatility. DAI continued to outpace loans outstanding, comprising over 42% of all loans outstanding ending the quarter.

USDC continues to be the second-largest loan market in Compound with $1.3 billion in outstanding loans, down 41%, or $2.2 billion from the prior quarter. Outstanding deposits declined at a slower rate of 37%, resulting in a utilization ratio decline of 6.2%. USDC borrower rates experienced far less volatility compared to the prior quarter with an average annualized interest rate of 3.56% in Q1. Interest rates peaked at 5.09% while bottoming at 2.62% in the quarter.

Outstanding loans and deposits in USDT fell modestly compared to DAI and USDC. Loans denominated in USDT declined 14.5%, from $649 million in Q4 to $555 million in Q1. Subsequently, deposits fell 17% from $798 million in Q4 to $663 million. Utilization rates increased 2.9% over the quarter, with USDT borrower rates averaging 3.85%. After hitting a floor of 2.25%, interest rates began to increase, reaching 5.85% towards the end of the quarter.

WBTC is the only asset within the top five in the protocol to experience a single-digit decline of 9.7% in outstanding deposits, falling from $1.8 billion in Q4 to $1.6 billion in Q1. In contrast, outstanding loans (USD) declined 62.7% from $134 million in Q4 to $50 million as the quarter ended.

WETH continues to be Compound’s largest market by deposits outstanding. Because KPI metrics were largely down in both outstanding loans and outstanding deposits during a very turbulent Q1, WETH liquidation metrics would logically benefit. WETH markets experienced a gut-wrenching 665% increase in liquidations, up from $14 million in Q4 to $106 million in Q1. This activity was mostly captured at the end of January and cooled off as the quarter wrapped up. Outstanding loans (USD) declined substantially by 61%, while outstanding deposits (USD) declined by 35%.

WETH represents 36% of outstanding deposits and continues to outpace deposits denominated in other assets quarter-over-quarter.

Governance &amp; Key Events:

Key Events

MakerDAO Deposit Module

GFX Labs and the Compound community proposed to MakerDAO to prioritize launching a Compound DAI Direct Deposit Module (D3M), which is a Maker Protocol implementation that enables Maker to directly inject DAI into the Compound DAI borrowing market. MakerDAO voting passed a poll in January.

Compound Comprehensive Protocol Audit

The Compound community recently voted to approve a long-term security partnership with OpenZeppelin, conducting audits over select Compound governance proposals along with advisory services and monitor solutions. Throughout the quarter, they’ve identified several vulnerabilities which were laid out to the community with recommendations for future proposal upgrades.

COMP Rewards Dissolution

A proposal was passed and executed at the end of March to reduce COMP rewards by 50% immediately and then winding down rewards to zero within a month.

Governance Decisions

Proposal 081 – Risk Parameter Updates for ETH (Exec. 01/18/22)

Proposal 081 made parameter adjustments to the ETH market, changing the collateral factor from 80% to 82.5%.

Proposal 082 – Dynamic Risk Parameters – Quarterly Update (Exec. 01/24/22)

This proposal reviews Gauntlet&#39;s partnership with Compound and updates its streaming grant for Q1 2022. Gauntlet proposes a quarterly fee of 8,168 COMP for the quarter.

In addition, as was requested by the &lt;a href=&#34;https://messari.io/governor/proposal/9a0e2ea9-572e-424a-9395-8649253e03fe&#34;&gt;Compound community&lt;/a&gt;, Gauntlet will replace its existing COMP stream with a Sablier stream. This governance proposal sets the Contributor Comp Speed to Gauntlet to zero and sets up a Sablier stream to Gauntlet instead.

Gauntlet has launched the Risk Dashboard, implemented five sets of parameter recommendations, published two monthly risk reviews, and safely unlocked additional borrow for Compound while maintaining protocol risk at safe levels.

Proposal 083 – Add Markets: FEI (Exec. 02/10/22)

FEI USD was added as an algorithmic stablecoin on Compound with the following risk parameters: collateral factor 0%, reserve factor 25%, borrow limit — none, COMP rewards — none, and price source — Chainlink (Uniswap V2 FEI/ETH).

Proposal 085 – Risk Parameter Updates for UNI, LINK, MKR, AAVE, YFI, and SUSHI (Exec. 02/28/22)

Proposal 085 made parameter adjustments to six Compound assets as follows: cAAVE collateral factor from 60% to 65%, cLINK collateral factor from 70% to 75%, cMKR collateral factor from 55% to 60%, cSUSHI collateral factor from 55% to 60%, and cYFI collateral factor from 60% to 65%.

Proposal 087 – Oracle Update (Exec. 03/17/22)

This proposal by GFX Labs aimed to update the protocol&#39;s price oracle to the Uniswap Anchored View. Chainlink currently pays double the gas costs to maintain prices on the current oracle and the pending oracle. All existing markets retain the same configuration, and FRAX, LUSD, and RAI are introduced.

*The introduction of FRAX, LUSD, and RAI to the oracle was on a best-efforts basis and exists for governance’s consideration in future asset-specific governance votes. Their addition is not an endorsement or opposition to their addition to the protocol.

Proposal 089 – Lower Proposal Threshold to 25,000 COMP (Exec. 03/19/22)

This proposal aims to lower the Compound protocol’s proposal threshold from 65,000 COMP to 25,000 COMP.

The proposal additionally sets the minimum settable proposal threshold in GovernorBravoDelegate to 1,000 (this allows for lowering the proposal threshold in the future). The new change will allow anyone with a minimum of 25,000 COMP to make formal governance proposals on-chain for votes. The proposal grants 5 COMP to Ratan to reimburse gas fees for deploying the new GovernorBravoDelegate contract.

This proposal follows Proposal 88 by GFX Labs which was canceled and aimed at lowering the proposal threshold to 10,000 COMP.

Based on community feedback, there was an agreement to reduce the proposal threshold from 65,000 to 25,000 COMP. This new threshold enables an additional 17 EOAs to make proposals, empowering more community members to participate in governance and programmatically reducing the barrier to entry for delegates.

Proposal 090 – Risk Parameter Updates for ZRX, MKR, and SUSHI (Exec. 03/21/22)

Proposal 090 made parameter adjustments to three Compound assets as follows: cMKR collateral factor from 60% to 65%, cSUSHI collateral factor from 60% to 65%, and cZRX collateral factor from 60% to 65%.

Proposal 092 COMP Rewards Adjustments – Kickstart Rewards: Step One (Exec. 03/26/22)

This proposal aims to build on previous discussions in &lt;a href=&#34;https://messari.io/governor/proposal/c461f142-2645-446a-b4ad-c93f94de13cb&#34;&gt;COMP Reward Adjustments&lt;/a&gt; by ending the current COMP rewards program and starting a new COMP rewards program with the primary purpose of kickstarting new markets. This proposal will immediately cut existing COMP rewards by 50% and after one month will cut COMP rewards to zero. The proposal will introduce a program to identify interest rate models across all markets. Once the interest rate model is optimized, the team will establish an effective rewards program to kickstart new markets.

The initial objective of the COMP rewards program was to reward protocol users with tokens. While this was an effective way to onboard and reward early adopters, the practice of COMP farming for profit is not sustainable.

Most COMP rewards have been distributed to mercenary capital, which they immediately sell off. This causes a great disservice to the existing users and tokenholders, ultimately diluting their share of the protocol. These incentives need to be used strategically to grow the protocol to the benefit of Compound, users, and tokenholders.

Proposal 092 is the first step toward launching the new rewards program. Existing rewards are being cut by 50%.

Governance Discussions

GFX Lab’s proposal includes a laundry list of protocol improvements — here are a few key:

Deploy Compound V2 to L2s and side chains reducing gas fees and increasing accessibility
Transition off legacy cTokens across markets, improving protocol revenue and corresponding interest rate models and bringing upside for the protocol
Allocate resources to research, test, and upgrade existing interest rate curves, liquidation mechanisms, and developer code base

Certora’s Verification proposal aims to significantly and continuously improve the security of the Compound platform by offering a formal verification and path coverage tooling service to contributors and dApp developers within Compound. 

Grant Program Overview

The community learned from the wildly successful Compound Grant Program (CGP) 1.0, which funded over $1 million in over 30 grants. The second iteration, CGP 2.0, is currently being designed with the vision to build the best community-led organization possible. The protocol plans to staff a full-time team to develop clear communication processes that enable more transparency across the community. However, the CGP has remained paused in Q1, due to a lack of focused resources to develop plans to launch CGP 2.0.

Road Map

Multi-chain Strategy

In an effort to adapt to the rapidly changing blockchain landscape and learn from the challenges experienced during the development of Gateway, the Compound community has chosen to first establish a presence on EVM-compatible chains as fragmented multi-chain markets with shared liquidity pools.

Compound Treasury

Scaling Compound Treasury will continue to be a focus in 2022. The Treasury is a centrally managed product built on top of the protocol. It is designed for non-crypto-native businesses and financial institutions, operating as an institutional on-ramp to Compound markets.

Compound III

Compound III is an EVM compatible protocol that enables supplying of crypto assets as collateral in order to borrow the base asset. The initial deployment of Compound III is on Ethereum and the base asset is USDC. The supply and borrow interest rates are bound by separate curves that have a utilization “kink” affecting the rate calculation. Accounts can only earn interest by supplying the base asset.  

The evolution of Compound relies heavily on community contributions through governance. Even if many members agree on what protocol improvements should take place, efforts can be stalled due to the allocation of resources and compensation structures of contributors.

Closing Thoughts

Compound’s overall activity was largely influenced by the volatility of the broader market in the quarter. Retreating from Q4 market all-time-highs, users’ appetite for loans and deposits declined sharply in Q1. This sentiment appears to be the primary driver in the decline of both borrower and deposit interest rates as well as protocol income, consequently resulting in triple-digit percentage increases in liquidations from the prior quarter.

With COMP rewards being slashed by 50% at the end of Q1 and plans to be ultimately brought to zero in the following month &lt;a href=&#34;https://messari.io/governor/proposal/c461f142-2645-446a-b4ad-c93f94de13cb&#34;&gt;(Proposal 092),&lt;/a&gt; Compound markets should start to stabilize, shaking out mercenary capital who are the primary beneficiaries of incentive rewards. These protocol participants immediately sell off rewards, which can negatively impact COMP price and tokenholders. As a response, Compound is aiming to optimize markets across the board and introduce effective incentives to kickstart new markets. These actions should result in a net positive for COMP tokenholders, fostering a healthier and more sustainable protocol.

The recent onboarding of OpenZeppelin’s security partnership and Gauntlet’s risk dashboards are great examples of collaboration through governance. For Compound to remain competitive with the likes of AAVE and MakerDAO, critical protocol improvements in the near term are paramount. As COMP incentives diminish in the coming month, community members will need to continue driving strategic initiatives through governance to attract new users, increase market efficiencies, and ultimately improve the protocol’s dominant position in the market.

The Sandbox focuses on partnerships across gaming, music, entertainment, and sports engagement.

The Sandbox in a Nutshell

The Sandbox is a platform for both creating and hosting entertainment experiences in virtual worlds. In The Sandbox, anyone can create 3D assets like buildings, in-game items, and non-player characters. These assets can then be used to build diverse experiences including games, music and fashion events, social activities, quests, art exhibits, and contests. The Sandbox offers creators a set of intuitive tools that require no background in coding or in designing experiences. These tools include a 3D editor for making and animating items, a game maker for making experiences, and a game client. The Sandbox is actively working on making these tools as user-friendly as possible in order to unleash the creativity of its community. For instance, the 3D editor combines different in-game tokens to create user-generated assets.

These user-generated assets are ERC-721 non-fungible tokens that can be monetized on open markets. The Sandbox ecosystem leverages a series of tokenized gaming features including: a digital in-game currency used for purchases, monetization, and asset creation (i.e., SAND); ownable digital land within The Sandbox virtual world (LAND); a combination of LANDs to create a larger plot (ESTATE); a bundle of assets and scripting logic to create interactive experiences (GAMES); 3D virtual images created by players (ASSETS); tokens burnt to give attributes to assets (GEMS); and tokens burnt to create ASSETS (CATALYSTS). Thanks to the tradeable nature of these user-generated assets within its virtual world, The Sandbox has robust in-game economics.

In addition to owning the assets that they build, creators will be able to make experiences available on LAND parcels in The Sandbox Metaverse. The long-term goal of The Sandbox is to enable creators to build immersive experiences. The possibility to monetize LAND and in-game experiences has attracted investors to acquire LAND. The top owners of LAND include large investors in The Sandbox, such as Binance, Everyrealm, and Galaxy Interactive, as well as NFT communities such as Whale, MetaKovan, and Cyber Kongz. In addition, The Sandbox is actively forming partnerships with businesses that are willing to develop experiences within its virtual world and become early adopters. These partnerships span a suite of business verticals including gaming, music, entertainment, fashion, and lifestyle, to name a few. Partnership examples are presented in “The Sandbox Ecosystem: Notable Events” section below.

Macro Overview

There is a finite amount of Sandbox LAND — 166,464 parcels. New LAND parcels are subject to primary sales — they are sold to private entities (in partnerships) or released for sale through auctions. Notably, 65% of all the LAND parcels have already been distributed, up 2% from Q4 2021.

As the volatile Q1 2022 has come to a close, LAND secondary sales volume decreased by 54% compared to the previous quarter. To put this into perspective, the secondary sales volume in Q1 2022 is still up 865% relative to Q3 2021. This quarter&#39;s decrease is the result of the metaverse hype starting to settle down since Meta&#39;s rebrand announcement in October 2021. The market is merely finding its equilibrium, and demand for LAND remains healthy despite the buying frenzy of Q4 2021.

At the same time, relative to Q2 2021, primary LAND sales grew 23%. The subject of primary sales are LAND parcels that are newly issued and are usually either sold to partners or through auctions. Still, primary LAND sales volume ($16 million) accounted for only 12% of the marketplace LAND sales volume ($136 million) in Q1 2021.

In terms of usage, The Sandbox launched the Alpha Season 2 of its gameplay in March 2022. Notably, during this launch, The Sandbox reached 2 million registered users. Considering the launch lasted four weeks, tracking its active daily or monthly users isn’t useful at this point. Instead, unique LAND buyers may be an alternative proxy for the interest in LAND utility.

The number of monthly active LAND buyers is back to the more sustainable levels seen before Meta’s announcement in late October 2021. This poses the question of what drives the value of digital land in The Sandbox virtual world, given that only a limited number of its users are currently being able to host and monetize experiences.

In our &lt;a href=&#34;https://messari.io/article/the-state-of-the-sandbox-q4-2021&#34;&gt;previous quarterly report&lt;/a&gt;, an in-depth analysis uncovered that LAND ownership is fairly concentrated, with the top owners holding onto their parcels. A follow-up question is whether this holding behavior is specific only to top owners. This quarter’s report analyzes the LAND holding time and discusses the potential implications on the value of land in virtual worlds.

Micro Overview — Holding Behavior

In an effort to understand LAND holding time, one may consider various clusters of buy &amp; hold behavior. In this sense, one can think, for instance, of long-term buying behavior as holding onto parcels for longer than one year, while buy &amp; sell could be described as holding periods shorter than 30 days. The current breakdown of the LAND holding time reveals that 7% of purchasers hold LAND for longer than one year, while 11% of purchasers hold LAND for less than 30 days. At the same time, the vast majority (72%) of LAND buyers hold the asset for 1–3 months.

In other words, 83% of buyers choose to sell their LAND sooner than 3 months after the purchase. This hints towards profit taking as a driver for LAND owners to buy &amp; sell their assets. Below we analyze the profit taking behavior by looking at buy &amp; sell transactions that took place within 30 days. For each of these buy &amp; sell transactions, the difference between the sale price and the corresponding buy price is summed up on a daily basis.

Note that peak profit taking occurred on Nov. 24, 2021 — roughly one month after the Meta rebrand announcement. Since then, profit-taking behavior returned to sustainable levels. Additionally, since October 2020, only 19 days have seen negative aggregate profitability, with Dec. 31, 2021 having the largest negative balance. One may consider LAND buying potentially as a call option on The Sandbox gaining massive user traction.

Despite the high interest in The Sandbox gameplay experiences signaled by the 2 million user registrations, &lt;a href=&#34;https://messari.io/article/the-digital-land-debate&#34;&gt;the case for digital land&lt;/a&gt; is still in its early days in terms of the building of experiences. Intuitively, making immersive experiences available in The Sandbox may be a potential catalyst for sustainable value creation and capture. In this sense, users are eagerly awaiting immersive crypto-consumer gameplay experiences to be launched. Creators are well positioned to build immersive virtual experiences and make them available for users. In terms of capturing that value, owners may acquire specific LAND parcels with the hope that hosting virtual experiences on those parcels may, in turn, drive increased user activity. This could further create a flywheel for immersive experiences to be adopted on a large-scale, which, in turn, would boost the value of LAND parcels over the long-term.

However, it is not presently possible for creators to make experiences available to others using LAND parcels. This may hinder real demand for the time being. While most LAND buyers may be initially inclined to hold, the absence of practical means to monetize LAND though hosting of experiences may tempt them to take profits. It is thus important for The Sandbox to continue building the backbone for immersive experiences and increased accessibility by users.

For The Sandbox to continue to grow and thrive, immersive experiences will need to be created and adopted on a large-scale. In this sense, an important metric to follow will be the number of active users of full gameplay releases that are not bound to specific time intervals.

The Sandbox Ecosystem: Notable Events

Partnerships

Brands show no signs of fatigue in joining The Sandbox ecosystem. Driven by the vast possibilities of building and monetizing experiences, a series of brands have announced partnerships with The Sandbox on several verticals, notably: gameplay (Ubisoft, SM Media, and Ethernity), music (Warner Music Group), entertainment (SHIBUYA109), diversity and inclusion (World of Women), sports and gaming engagement (HSBC), and fashion and lifestyle (Gucci, Arianee). Developing further partnerships will remain a focus area for The Sandbox for the foreseeable future.

The Sandbox Alpha Season 2

In March of 2021, The Sandbox launched Alpha Season 2 of its virtual world. The gameplay was bound to 4 weeks and enabled users to get Alpha Passes and earn SAND, the utility and governance token of The Sandbox. For the first time, The Sandbox reached the milestone of 2 million registered users. As part of Alpha Season 2, The Sandbox released 200 quests and 35+ experiences that were available to PC and Mac users that registered with a free account. The Sandbox looks to continue growing its user base with the upcoming Season 3 announcement.

Staking on Polygon

The Sandbox introduced gasless mSAND staking in February. While SAND already maintains a liquidity pool on Uniswap, this program allows everyone on Polygon to get a share of the 500,000 mSAND weekly rewards. In addition, mSAND holders who provide liquidity to the program will be eligible to share a monthly allocation of 500,000 mSAND. Further staking rewards have been introduced during The Sandbox Alpha Season 2.

Roadmap

Looking ahead, The Sandbox has a few notable developments in the pipeline.

Progressive Decentralization

Through progressive decentralization, The Sandbox aims to incentivize its community to come up with their own experiences. That is, The Sandbox is inspiring its community to build experiences for players and potentially unleash the next generation of massively successful games. While not yet deployed, The Sandbox DAO will be able to vote on Foundation grants as well as make decisions on game developments. The Sandbox DAO will be governed by both SAND token holders and LAND owners.

Network Effects and Ecosystem Growth

As LAND will continue to be gradually opened and distributed in 2022, The Sandbox needs to grow its network effects. There will be a sustained effort in securing further partnerships and growing its ecosystem. The aim is to scale and attract various businesses — metaverse agencies, fashion houses, virtual real estate marketplaces. Ideally, these businesses would establish their own sales, leading to job creation and a wider variety of experiences available to players in The Sandbox.

Launch of Public In-Game Experiences

The Sandbox is still in alpha, which means that in-game experiences are presently unavailable. Once available, these in-game experiences are expected to further grow The Sandbox user base. Throughout the following quarters, The Sandbox plans to allow users to publish experiences directly on their LAND parcels so that other players can access them.

Closing Summary

The Sandbox ecosystem continued its growth in Q1 2022, with notable partnerships and over 2 million registered users upon launching the Alpha Season 2 gameplay. This past quarter, The Sandbox also experienced the effects of the overall market pullback. As the metaverse hype started to settle down, marketplace sales of digital land came back to sustainable levels. The ambitions of The Sandbox are wide-ranging, with the potential to become one of the largest experience-based entertainment platforms.

Based on its numbers and partnerships, The Sandbox remains at the forefront of virtual worlds. But, there remain some potential headwinds. The real test for the long-term viability of The Sandbox is building the technology backbone for more immersive experiences for its future players. With the success of the Alpha version launch, now is the time to test what works, track the adoption of features, and to be strategic about the roadmap and its execution. The ability to quickly pivot and adopt the most suitable strategy for the technical development of its virtual world will be key. For The Sandbox to become a true entertainment metaverse, immersive experiences will need to be created and adopted on a large-scale.

Key Insights

Q1 2022 consisted of continued growth and the stabilization of network usage, financial performance, and network infrastructure.
Quarterly growth can be attributed to the continued deployment of Avalanche Rush, the Blizzard ecosystem fund, Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) subnet development, and the introduction of the Multiverse subnet incentive program and Culture Catalyst fund.
With further releases of Apricot and the launch of subnets anticipated, average transaction fees should continue to stabilize and trend downwards.
Avalanche showed signs of capturing market share versus top EVM-compatible chains across several key metrics over Q1.
The user experience is expected to improve with the launching of a browser extension and a mobile wallet, set to be released in Q2.
Along with the continued development of subnets, the launch of the browser extension and a mobile wallet will enable native bridging between subnets.

A Primer on Avalanche

The Avalanche network is a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) smart contract platform for decentralized applications. Whereas most competitors use consensus mechanisms in the Classical or Nakamoto families, Avalanche differentiates itself through its creation and implementation of a new consensus family known as “Avalanche consensus.” Following years of research, the Avalanche mainnet was launched in September 2020 and featured the release of a multichain framework utilizing three chains (the P, X, and C chains). Each chain plays a critical and unique role within the Avalanche ecosystem while providing the same capabilities of a single network.

As a follow-up to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://messari.io/article/state-of-avalanche-q4-2021?referrer=asset:avalanche&#34;&gt;State of Avalanche Q4 2021&lt;/a&gt; report, this report will revisit developments and events from the prior quarter, analyze the network’s most recent quarterly performance, and give insight into the coming months. A full appendix of data tables is available at the end of the report.

The First Quarter Narrative

&lt;a href=&#34;https://messari.io/article/state-of-avalanche-q4-2021?referrer=asset:avalanche&#34;&gt;Q4 2021&lt;/a&gt; was a period of high growth for the Avalanche network. With the Ethereum–Avalanche bridge, major exchange listings, high-profile partnerships, and the Avalanche Rush liquidity program, the network was positioned to grow its user base and welcome new participants into its economy. As individuals and institutions piled in, Avalanche recorded all-time-highs in active addresses, daily transactions, total value locked (TVL), and market capitalization. As we moved into the new year, additional growth strategies and developments were on the horizon, but it was unknown whether the network would continue growing, experience a downturn, or show signs of stabilization.

Ultimately, Q1 2022 consisted of continued growth and the stabilization of network usage, financial performance, and network infrastructure. The outcomes were attributed to several key developments: the continued deployment of Avalanche Rush, the Blizzard ecosystem fund, Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) subnet development, and the introduction of the Multiverse subnet incentive program and Culture Catalyst fund. As existing enterprise partners such as Deloitte began to implement business solutions, new partnerships were formed over the quarter.

Network Overview

Across the board, Avalanche experienced modest growth compared to the prior quarter, and its key metrics stabilized across the network. While the market cap was relatively flat (-5.4%), the network experienced continued uptrends in usage, revenue generation, and a move towards favorable fundamental valuation. Average daily transactions nearly doubled over the quarter (+82.8%), total revenue grew by 72.7%, and the price-to-sales (P/S) ratio continued to settle down, with the ratio of price relative to revenue moving from 160x to 91x.

As a result, daily active addresses did not reverse course, and instead, adoption continued as active addresses reached an all-time-high of 140,000 in January. For perspective, Avalanche had more active users in the first week of January than in all of October 2021. The network averaged around 70,000 daily active addresses during Q4 and reached a stable range with an average of 92,000 during Q1.

Similar to Q4, transaction activity on the network followed a similar pattern to daily active address growth. On aggregate, Avalanche&#39;s average daily transactions rose from 473,000 last quarter to 865,000 in Q1, which is ~ 74% of Ethereum’s roughly 1.17 million. Daily transactions continued their upward trend with additional DeFi application launches and the rollout of GameFi subnets such as DeFi Kingdoms Crystalvale and Crabada. Ultimately, while on testnet, Crabada would become the top transaction driver on Avalanche during Q1. Beyond DeFi and GameFi, total 24 hour NFT volume surpassed $1 million for the first time, while the NFT market cap broke $110 million.

Throughout 2021, the network experienced volatility in average daily transaction fees. With further releases of Apricot, transaction fees have since stabilized, averaging around $0.67 per transaction. Apricot is intended to facilitate &#34;verifiable pruning,&#34; a process where nodes can securely compact historical transactions. It features a fee mechanism that enables transaction costs to be low and predictable for users. While stable, transaction fees have been trending upward in tandem with daily transactions. With more anticipated releases of Apricot, we should expect to see average transaction fees continue to stabilize and trend downwards.

Further, the continued launch of subnets should put downward pressure on transaction fees. Subnets are a horizontal scaling strategy that aims to validate Avalanche blockchains running in parallel, enabling transaction order, and increased performance by splitting up network traffic allowing for optimization and more control over transaction fees.

Intuitively, as daily active addresses and transactions grew, total revenue increased. Revenue grew by 72.7% over the quarter, and cumulative revenue became a more significant fraction of the network FDV. To put it into perspective, cumulative revenue as a percentage of FDV is 20x from a year ago, which signals that fundamentals like network revenue are moving more in line with market value.

Avalanche’s network revenue (transaction fees) is atypical for smart contract platforms. Rather than distributing transaction fees to validators, 100% of fees are burned from the network’s circulating supply. This drives value to all token holders through increased scarcity rather than compounding the balances of validators and delegators. In other words, revenue growth should put upward pressure on the market value of AVAX. The question is just how statistically significant the spread between revenue and market value is. With that in mind, as fundamental value (as opposed to speculative value) becomes a more substantial part of market value, a strong correlation between revenue and market value should theoretically exist.

Most notably, a spike in daily revenue on November 22, 2021, was accompanied by a spike in FDV. The same relationship exists between circulating market cap and price. Additionally, the spread between the two variables tightened during Q1, with occasional spikes in revenue once again accompanied by spikes in FDV. As the spread tightens, the network usage becomes more correlated to the market value. This correlation could indicate that the network is moving closer to fundamental value versus speculative value. If the relationship holds, then revenue will have a significant relationship with network value.

Since June 2021, engaged stake and nominal staking yields have been stable, with an average annualized yield of ~10%. One of the last significant token unlocks occurred during March, but there was no indication of a change in engaged stake. Should those tokens engage or disengage in staking, there could be additional volatility in yield over the near term.

Ecosystem &amp; Development Overview

Heading into 2022, Avalanche DeFi was expected to be fueled by the ongoing Avalanche Rush program and the new $200 million Blizzard ecosystem fund. Over the course of Q1, Pangolin (PNG), an Avalanche native DEX, and Terra (LUNA) joined the Rush program and combined to bring TerraUSD (UST) to the Avalanche ecosystem. In total, $2 million in AVAX incentives were combined with additional LUNA and PNG rewards to incentivize usage.

Continued network adoption was also evident in Avalanche development activity with unique contracts deployed and contract deployers having grown by 60.9% and 13.1%, respectively. Although development marched forward, TVL declined by 5.5%.

The TVL decline would have been more drastic if not for the continued growth and development in the DeFi sector. TVL is highly sensitive to overall market valuations. While TVL on Avalanche experienced a slight decline, top DeFi protocols Aave, Benqi, and Trader Joe experienced TVL declines of 4%, 18%, and 20%, respectively. Their collective TVL declined by 12% — more than twice the total Avalanche DeFi ecosystem’s decline. Essentially, the continued growth and development of newer and smaller protocols in the Avalanche DeFi ecosystem offset the market forces negatively impacting top protocol TVL. Ultimately, like other metrics in the Avalanche ecosystem, TVL appears to have also stabilized at around $11 billion.

Aave, Trader Joe, and Benqi solidified their positions as the top three DeFi protocols after joining Rush in Q4. Collectively, these three protocols experienced a 12% decline in TVL, which is greater than the decline of the entire Avalanche DeFi ecosystem. The disconnect between the greater decrease in TVL across the top DeFi protocols and the lower decline of the entire DeFi ecosystem can be attributed to additional launches of DeFi services on the network, such as the launch of Platypus Finance (PTP).

Platypus Finance is a stableswap protocol that was the fastest growing DeFi application over the quarter, having grown from just $10 million to over $750 million in TVL, representing a ~7,500% increase. Platypus also became one of the top 10 applications generating network transactions on Avalanche.

Additional launches and Rush deployments, such as Pangolin and Terra, helped prop up Avalanche’s TVL despite overall market declines. The other notable trend across Q1 was the steady long tail of DeFi protocols on Avalanche. Entering Q1, 60 protocols had amassed $1 million TVL, up from just 29 from the prior quarter. Exiting Q1, 60 protocols maintained the $1 million TVL mark. Despite the flat to down quarter, the number of applications with recorded TVL grew from 100 to 150.

Q1 marked the beginning of Avalanche’s highly anticipated GameFi subnet launches. Crabada quickly passed 5,000 users, measured by the number of unique wallet addresses interacting with the application&#39;s smart contracts. Daily transactions grew from 60,000 to over 400,000 over Q1, measured by transactions made to Crabada’s smart contracts. Daily volume generally ranged between $130,000 and $1.5 million as measured by the total amount of incoming value to the application&#39;s smart contracts. Finally, the TVL in the application&#39;s smart contracts neared $50 million by the end of the quarter. Ultimately, the emergence of new DeFi and GameFi applications was fueled by continued growth in developer metrics.

Q1 developer activity in the Avalanche ecosystem aligns closely with the network&#39;s overall TVL growth and recent entry into GameFi. The number of unique contracts deployed grew by 60.9% quarter over quarter and reached an all-time-high in March, just as Crabada and DeFi Kingdoms launched their subnets. The number of unique contract deployers slowed on a month-to-month basis but still managed to grow by 13.1% quarter over quarter. With the deployment of the Multiverse and Culture Catalyst funds, March&#39;s surge in contract deployments should continue through Q2 2022.

The growth of events in the Ava Lab’s Github repository grew significantly (76.4%) throughout Q1. Given this was the greatest increase to date, the number of events indicates that the network’s core team is accelerating the infrastructure buildout.

Staking and Decentralization Overview

The security of PoS networks like Avalanche requires users to lock up the network’s native tokens and participate in validation duties. A distributed network of validators and active participants can help ensure the network functions as intended.

After a downwards trend at the beginning of 2021, engaged stake settled at around 60%, which has been maintained through Q1 2022.

Staking amounts during Q1 were relatively uneventful, with average stake changes in the single digits quarter over quarter. Such predictability and lack of volatility are generally good for network health. Validator stake was consistently about 5.85 times greater than the amount of delegated stake. The amounts of unresponsive validator stake were higher than average on a few days, but the total amount of offline stake never came close to levels that could compromise the network.

While the average staking amount was relatively flat, there was a material increase in the average number of validators and delegators. The average validator count grew from 1,138 to 1,259, representing a 10.6% increase in network security participants. The number of average validators joining the network stayed at about 11% growth each quarter. This stability is indicative of a growing, decentralized network.

Each new Avalanche subnet will be required to validate on the Avalanche P-chain. As more subnets launch, the average number of validators should increase in tandem. The average number of delegators also grew from 16,459 to 17,179, representing a 4.4% increase. The number of delegators consistently outnumbered the number of validators, consistent with other PoS networks that support native delegation. The average number of offline validators continued to decline, decreasing by 14.9% over the quarter. Ultimately, low volatility in the network’s staked AVAX combined with an increase in validators and delegators is a sign of healthy decentralization.

The Nakamoto coefficient is a metric first introduced by Balaji Srinivasan to quantify the decentralization of blockchain networks. The coefficient represents the minimum number of actors who can collude to disrupt the network. For Avalanche, the Nakamoto coefficient equals the number of validators that control one-third of the network’s stake. Avalanche’s Nakamoto coefficient hovered in the low 30s to begin 2021 but fell to 25 in June. Since this decline, the coefficient has remained stable in the upper 20s, putting Avalanche above the industry average for other Layer-1 networks.

Competitive Analysis

Currently, the Layer-1 space is a competitive race between new and legacy protocols to achieve the maximum possible network speed at the lowest possible cost and with the greatest degree of security. Each competitor has focused on maximizing these activities while making a range of trade-offs regarding centralization. The ideal blockchain would be fast, secure, widely used, and adequately decentralized.

The core technical advancements, developer activity, and ecosystem growth strategies may separate one L1 from another. Here, we evaluate Avalanche’s progress versus the top five EVM compatible chains (including Avalanche) by TVL. The methodology used to derive this peer group is simply by grouping the EVM chains with the largest TVL, seeing as today, DeFi is the sector driving the majority of each network’s economic activity.

Avalanche experienced the lowest decline in value in terms of market cap and closed in on BNB Chain market share while further separating itself from Fantom and Polygon.

Similarly, Avalanche’s daily revenue trended upward. At the same time, all other EVM chains experienced a decline, allowing for Avalanche to close in on BNB Chain and further separate from Fantom and Polygon.

Avalanche’s P/S ratio declined over the quarter, while other chains aside from Fantom experienced an increase in this valuation metric. From a relative valuation perspective, Avalanche is now more in line with Ethereum with a P/S of 91x versus Ethereum’s 81.5x.

Both Avalanche and Fantom reached similar levels in Q1 daily transactions. Ethereum has held steady at ~1.17 million transactions per day, with Avalanche now reaching ~74% of Ethereum’s average daily transactions. With the incentive programs taking hold and subnet launches on the way, Avalanche has an interesting opportunity to surpass Ethereum over the next quarter.

Q1 was a flat to down quarter for the crypto market, with aggregate TVL decreasing from $240 billion to $230 billion. Avalanche’s TVL declined at the second slowest rate among the top EVM chains, only trailing behind Fantom. A significant portion of Avalanche’s stability came at the expense of Ethereum, BNB Chain, and Polygon, each declining by double-digit percentages. As the above chart illustrates, Avalanche closed in on BNB Chain in this area. The Avalanche Mcap/TVL ratio also ended among the lowest. As a measure of network value relative to TVL, it signifies a closer relationship between the network value and the DeFi economic activity occurring on the network.

Key Events, Catalysts, and Strategies for Ecosystem Growth

Q1 2022 proved to be another significant quarter for the Avalanche ecosystem. Indeed, growth strategies and development activity contributed to Avalanche&#39;s ecosystem growth, as evidenced by the data presented in the previous sections of this report. The results can be attributed to several key developments:

The continued deployment of Avalanche Rush
Deployment of the Blizzard ecosystem fund
Custom EVM subnet development
Introduction of the Multiverse program and Culture Catalyst fund

January 2022

Avalanche&#39;s Q1 began with the launch of the Subnet-Ethereum Virtual Machine, a custom VM that enables users to easily and rapidly create their own, configurable EVM-compatible blockchain. By the end of the first week of January, Pangolin announced plans to launch its own subnet. During the first week of January, not only was the Avalanche ecosystem gearing up for subnets, it was introducing additional enterprise partners. Ava Labs entered into a strategic partnership with Turkey&#39;s electronic vehicle manufacturer Togg to design and build smart contract-based services to improve autonomous mobility.

By the middle of January, Bitwise, a prominent crypto index fund manager, reconstituted the Bitwise 10 Large Cap Crypto Index and added AVAX. Days later, Terra passed a proposal to bring UST to Avalanche with Liquidity Mining Proposal #3. Further ecosystem collaboration came about when Celsius Network announced support for Avalanche, allowing users to borrow against AVAX from a centralized provider. Further, 1inch, a widely used DeFi aggregator, was deployed on Avalanche.

January concluded with the first subnet launches on Avalanche with Spaces, a website allowing users to store and share links, images, and files all on-chain, and WAGMI, a subnet demo that is a high-throughput testbed for EVM optimizations. Finally, to round out the month, Anchor Protocol, the largest DeFi protocol on Terra, proposed and passed a UST borrowing strategy whereby sAVAX entered the platform as its newest collateral asset.

February 2022

As reported in Q4 2021, one of renowned street artist Banksy&#39;s most iconic pieces, Love is in the Air, became a fractionalized NFT on Avalanche. The NFT was made possible by Particle, which partnered with Avalanche to bring fine art on-chain in November. By February, the Banksy NFT generated interest and purchases by celebrities such as Paris Hilton. The Particle Banksy collection would later sell out in March.

Also reported in Q4, a multi-year agreement with Andretti Formula E Autosports marked the first title sponsorship from a blockchain company with a Formula E team with a natural alignment between organizations committed to sustainability. By mid-February, the Avalanche Andretti team made its debut at the Mexico City E-Prix, the Formula E World Championship.

March 2022

March was a pivotal month of Q1. The uptick witnessed in daily transactions was largely due to the launch of the Crabada and DeFi Kingdoms subnets with Crabada running testnet and DeFi Kingdoms live on mainnet. To support the growth and development of subnets, the Avalanche Foundation announced the launch of Avalanche Multiverse, a $290 million (~4 million AVAX) incentive program. The first subnet to receive incentives through the Multiverse program was DeFi Kingdoms. Subsequently, Wildlife Studios joined the Multiverse program and will be expanding its flagship game, Castle Crush, onto its own subnet, intending to integrate NFTs and tokens into the game.

At the end of March, the sold-out Avalanche Summit took place in Barcelona, Spain, with sponsors including Circle, Terra, and Bridge Tower Capital, to name a few. During this time, the Avalanche Foundation and Web3 social media platform Op3n announced a $100 million creator fund called Culture Catalyst. The fund intends to help creative projects launch on Avalanche and Op3n. The program&#39;s first recipient will be musician Grimes, who plans to create an &#34;intergalactic childrens&#39; metaverse book.&#34;

Ecosystem Challenges

Q1 did not present any drastic challenges like those that came with the growing pains of Q4. As reported last quarter, the Avalanche C-chain recorded new highs for daily transactions which caused the network to temporarily experience higher than usual transaction fees. This quarter, network optimizations known as Apricot quickly became apparent as average daily transaction fees declined and stabilized. With that in mind, transaction fees were trending upward towards the end of Q1 as daily transactions increased.

The anticipated solutions to scaling and lowering costs include governance, pruning, and subnet development, which will involve removing a gas limit mechanism, among other optimizations. The launch of subnets is in motion, and the horizontal scaling approach with subnets takes place will influence how transaction fees trend going forward.

The Road Ahead

Currently, Avalanche does not maintain an updated public-facing roadmap, so the protocol developments are not prescribed. However, it is expected that Avalanche Rush will continue to drive DeFi growth, Blizzard will support overall ecosystem expansion, Multiverse will drive subnet development, and Culture Catalyst will bring creative talent to the ecosystem.

It is also anticipated that core platform upgrades will continue. Significant upgrades (Apricot) are being implemented in six phases, following a successful series of Phase 5 in Q1. All phases of Apricot broadly represent one of the solutions (pruning) to the optimizing transaction fees.

As discussed during the Q4 Analyst Call, user experience improvement is of high priority. As part of this effort, Ava Labs announced details about &lt;a href=&#34;https://messari.io/intel/event/a6060efe-af6c-4977-8590-6fa4aac69678&#34;&gt;Core&lt;/a&gt;, a free, non-custodial wallet explicitly created for applications on Avalanche with native support for subnets. The first iteration of Core is a browser extension, with the second being the Core mobile wallet expected to be released in early Q2. Ava Labs also announced that the Avalanche Bridge will enable support for Bitcoin, allowing BTC holders to transfer their BTC onto Avalanche securely. Bitcoin support is also scheduled to go live on mainnet in Q2. Ultimately, Ava Lab’s goal is to make the user experience as seamless as possible, and the Core wallets and bridge developments are the first steps.

Avalanche on-chain governance is also still in development. AVAX will, at some point, be used to provide on-chain governance for critical network parameters where participants can vote on changes to the network and settle network upgrade decisions democratically. Some of these parameters will include factors such as the minimum staking amount, minting rate, and transaction fees.

While all Avalanche incentive programs may continue to catalyze ecosystem growth and garner more project launches and partnerships, significant technological advancements are critical for the teams developing the Avalanche infrastructure. The continued development of subnets and the launch of Core will play a key role. For subnets to flourish, Core will need to successfully support extended functionality for subnets, such as native bridging.

Closing Summary

Network usage, financial performance, development activity, and network infrastructure continued to grow and stabilize during Q1 2022. The growth was fueled by Avalanche Rush, the Blizzard ecosystem fund, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) subnet development, the Multiverse subnet incentive program, and the Culture Catalyst fund. Additionally, partnerships formed in Q4 with enterprises like Deloitte began implementing business solutions on Avalanche while more partnerships were formed. Altogether, Avalanche showed signs of capturing market share versus top EVM-compatible chains across several key metrics over the quarter.

Across the board, Avalanche experienced growth, and its key metrics stabilized across the network. While the market cap was relatively flat, the network experienced continued uptrends in usage, revenue generation, and a move towards favorable fundamental valuation. Further, continued network adoption was also evident in Avalanche development activity, with unique contracts deployed and contract deployers growing significantly.

Avalanche incentive programs may continue to provide a catalyst for ecosystem growth. These programs may attract more project launches and partnerships, however, significant technological advancements are at the forefront of the teams developing Avalanche infrastructure. Significant developments to monitor going forward will be the continued development of subnets and the launch of Core. For subnets to flourish, Core will need to successfully implement its objectives to support extended functionality for subnets, such as native bridging. Ultimately, as with all Layer-1 networks, tracking the growth of the Avalanche network and its progress towards optimization and user experience will be top of mind looking ahead into the next quarter.

Key Insights

Total trading volume and, correspondingly, liquidity provider fees, fell in Q1 2022 as the surge of interest in crypto and NFTs from Q4 2021 subsided.
Uniswap on Polygon found organic growth and became the leading non-Ethereum platform for V3 by transaction volume even though it was the latest network to go live; additional liquidity mining incentives in the upcoming quarter should continue to help drive growth.
The community is exploring areas for further expansion onto Celo and Gnosis Chain.
The Uniswap Grants Program gave out the largest grant wave in its history in Wave 6, which included a mix of grant proposals from the end of 2021.

Introduction to Uniswap

Uniswap facilitates the trading of tokens on the Ethereum network along with scaling solutions such as Optimism, Arbitrum, and Polygon. The protocol is recognized as a pioneer among decentralized exchanges (DEXs), first for its popularization of the X*Y=K constant product pricing curve of pooled liquidity in V2 – and subsequently for its concentrated liquidity and staggered trading fee features in V3. The constant product pricing curve has since been implemented across many other DEXs in the industry. The concentrated liquidity model and fee tiers continue to remain relatively unique across DEX applications.

To quickly recap, AMMs pair tokens into pools balanced by the aforementioned algorithm. Liquidity providers (LPs) can deposit funds into those liquidity pools where traders make trades by swapping tokens in and out — in effect, making trades with the pool. In exchange for providing liquidity, LPs earn transaction fees paid by the traders.

Important updates to the protocol in the past quarter include the rapid growth of trading activity on Polygon’s Proof-of-Stake (PoS) chain (hereinafter: Polygon). Though Polygon was the last of Uniswap’s scaling solutions to launch in 2021, Uniswap V3 transaction volume quickly surpassed other notable DEXs on Polygon, such as SushiSwap, QuickSwap, Balancer, on fractions of the total value locked (TVL) for other DEXs. Q1 2022 saw some important governance proposals as well: launches of V3 on Gnosis Chain and Celo have passed temperature checks and will be up for an on-chain vote shortly. One should also reasonably expect additional expansion proposals later this year.

After a volatile Q4 trading quarter, 2022 represents an opportunity for normalization. Benchmarking quarter-over-quarter metrics will shed light on how Uniswap and its LPs respond to concerns of a bear market. A full appendix of quarterly data is available at the end of the report.

Macro Overview

On the whole, Uniswap trading volume in Q1 2022 was 53.5% lower than the previous quarter. This corresponds with the global crypto market, which hit its peak market capitalization in Q4 2021 at $3 trillion and has since come back down to $2 billion. When token prices go up, trading volume generally increases as retail inventors become more interested; when token prices decrease, retail investors lose interest in crypto. And unlike Q4 2021, which saw both the resurgence of NFTs and all-time highs for BTC and ETH, trading activity in Q1 2022 has been more muted.

Overall market liquidity dipped in Q1 2022, but to a lesser degree than volume. V2 was the only network to see a liquidity decline over the quarter, falling by 25.7%, while all the others saw nominal increases at a small scale. Since V2 includes more long-tail token pairs, a decline in V2 liquidity does coincide with lower retail trading volume. Meanwhile, market liquidity really shined in Uniswap’s so-called scaling solutions, particularly Polygon. Polygon jumped almost 81.7% compared to the end of Q4 when it had just launched. The implications of Polygon’s big win will be revisited throughout the report. Arbitrum and Optimism each saw growth too at 72.9% and 34.7%, respectively.

Polygon’s liquidity growth is particularly impressive given the lack of liquidity mining incentives for users in Q1. For context, when the initial governance proposal was made, up to $15 million was set aside by the Polygon team for liquidity mining purposes and another $5 million was prepared to support the ecosystem. As of the first week of April, these incentives have now been implemented. Only time will tell how much of a boost it&#39;ll give to Polygon&#39;s existing success.

Daily LP fees fell 36.2% in Q1 2022 after jumping 54.0% in Q4 2021, resulting in final quarter-end numbers similar to the end of Q3 2021. Q4’s numbers were such outliers due to the mainstream popularity of NFTs and all-time highs for both BTC and ETH. On the non-Ethereum front, Arbitrum gives Polygon a serious run for its money while Optimism lags behind. This data implies Polygon sees more trading of blue-chip token pairs (and thus, lower fees) while popular Arbitrum pairs trade in the higher fee tiers.

Total trading markets also continued to climb from the previous quarter, across all products from V2 on Ethereum to each of Uniswap’s non-Ethereum networks. V2 continues to make up the vast majority of total available markets. V3 on Ethereum and Polygon comprise 11% of active markets while Optimism and Arbitrum remain negligible. As with market liquidity, Polygon grew the quickest in Q1, jumping almost 300% from the previous quarter. Given all the data, it’s clear Uniswap has found a home on Polygon.

Micro Overview

The markets on V3, while fewer in count, continue to trade more blue-chip token pairs. Trading activity on V3 also continues to rise on a quarter-over-quarter basis.

Top V2 Markets

The top four most actively traded V2 markets for Q1 2022 were the following pools:

USDC/WETH
USDT/WETH
SAITAMA/WETH
FXS/FRAX

Together, the four pools represent less than 0.001% of the count of tradeable V2 markets but comprise 19.4% of total trading volume. Activity – and trends – from these four markets can be seen as leading indicators for the direction of the overall V2 ecosystem. However, given the trading pattern similarities USDT/WETH shares with USDC/WETH, further analysis of the pool was replaced in favor of the FXS/FRAX market for the purposes of this report.

USDC/WETH

Data from USDC/WETH shows trading volume continuing to decline after the launch of V3. V2 volume in the most recent quarter only accounted for 3.2% of total volume, only a tenth of V2 volume in Q2 2021. A total of $2.7 billion was traded in the V2 pool in Q1 2022, a 24.5% decline from the previous quarter. The capital efficiency of V3 makes it likely USDC/WETH trading activity on V2 will continue to decline and give way to further volume increases in its V3 counterpart.

The chart above represents our methodology of tracking LP profits/losses. Three scenarios were evaluated to compare the profitability of providing liquidity to this pool: a user providing liquidity for 30-, 90-, and 180-day windows. These windows were rolled through the entire last year to compare the profitability of these actions across time. For each window period, the corresponding impermanent loss caused by price change in the first and last day of the window was deducted from the equivalent yield generated from trading fees. The result is a moving net profit metric displayed above.

The USDC/WETH pair is a prime market to take a liquidity stake in, given the high volume of trades facilitated by the pool. Because most price fluctuations would be hedged by trading fees earned by LPs, one could expect decent returns when trading volume is high.

Of the 365 days since Q2 of last year, only 52 of the rolling 180-day returns would have yielded losses for LPs who would’ve chosen to retract their liquidity on any of those days. Even fewer days would have led to a loss for shorter-term LPs: for rolling 30-day LPs, the total impermanent loss would have exceeded fees for only 45 days of the year and only 12 days for those supplying rolling 90-day LPs.

In Q1 2022 alone, performance gets even better. All rolling 90- and 180-day LP positions over the entire 90 days in Q1 would have yielded a positive profit. For the rolling 30-day LP, every position would have been profitable, except for January 22-27th and March 5th.

FXS/FRAX

Both tokens in the final V2 pool, FXS and FRAX, are tokens used by the &lt;a href=&#34;https://messari.io/article/frax-a-fractional-algorithmic-stablecoin&#34;&gt;Frax Protocol&lt;/a&gt;, an algorithmic stablecoin protocol built on a hybrid seigniorage model. FRAX is the actual stablecoin pegged to the US Dollar; FXS is the governance and value capture token used as partial collateral for FRAX. As a hybrid model, FRAX is collateralized by both the FXS token and a fraction of another stablecoin.

The extent to which the percentage of underlying collateral made up by FRAX and USDC or another stablecoin is determined by the collateral ratio, which changes with demand for FRAX. If FRAX supply is expanding, less stablecoin is needed; if FRAX is retracting, a higher collateral ratio of stablecoin is needed.

What’s important to know is that Frax has an FXS buyback program (Frax1559) for excess collateral. This occurs when yields are earned by the protocol’s stablecoin collateral, causing total collateral to increase above the required collateral ratio. Frax uses the extra earned capital to mint new FRAX tokens and buy back outstanding FXS tokens.

Thus, the trading volume of the Uniswap FXS/FRAX pool is driven by the Frax1559 buyback program and should be relatively stable as long as FRAX remains successfully pegged to the US Dollar. Its emergence as a top-three traded pair this quarter reflects this stability while other volatile pools saw their trading volume sink. In total, trading activity in Q1 rose 6.9% for the most recent quarter after increasing 243.1% in Q4 2021.

Another factor adding to increased trading was chatter of a pending airdrop. The airdrop is for the upcoming FPI token. A snapshot was taken on February 20th of FXS of those who staked FXS tokens or were LPs of the FXS/FRAX pool. Those who heard about airdrop eligibility might have contributed to market activity by trading for FXS tokens or contributing to the liquidity pool.

Unfortunately for LPs, the FXS/FRAX pool suffers mixed results. Trading fees were not strong prior to the implementation of FXS1559 while the token’s price fluctuated wildly. The combination resulted in heavy losses across all three rolling time frames. Once the buyback program was initiated, trading volume picked up substantially. Though FXS price volatility didn’t go away, the additional trading fees earned by LPs began to counteract impermanent loss, turning total LP fees positive.

SAITAMA/WETH

Last quarter, we described the rise of SAITAMA/WETH as a beneficiary of the November 2021 trading surge. After all, SAITAMA, as we noted, is the token for another of the doge-like projects that were so popular among retail investors, but its continued success has subverted expectations.

Not only was SAITAMA/WETH a top-performing market in Q4 2021, it continued to be so for Q1 2022. That said, the asset pair did see overall trading volume fall 67.6% from the previous quarter. The trading volume growth of the previous quarters could not be sustained after a 2,500%+ increase in Q3 and a 700%+ increase in Q4. This highlights the broader trend of retail trading in the crypto markets: H2 2021, and Q4 2021 in particular, were very strong for memecoins and the general market, while Q1 2022 experienced a pullback.

Market liquidity for SAITAMA/WETH fell almost 40% from the previous quarter. Yet this decline still is less than the decline in trading volume. This all occurred while the price of SAITAMA fell by more than 75% over the quarter. LPs that kept their capital in the pool could have done so for many reasons, including the possibility of high fees or forgetting to close their market-making position.

LPs who contributed liquidity to the SAITAMA/WETH pool saw a mix of positive and negative yields throughout the rolling 30-, 90-, and 180-day time frames. In line with expectations, most of the positive returns came in or after Q4 2021 when the trading volume began to pick up. Roughly 66%, or 62 out of 90 days in the quarter, led to positive returns for LPs over the 30-day time frame. The number of positive days increased to 82% for anyone supplying liquidity over a 90-day period but decreased to 32% for 180-day LPs, respectively.

Top V3 Markets

Unsurprisingly, the most active V3 markets are the USDC/WETH, USDC/USDT, and WBTC/WETH markets, which contributed 61.0% of V3 volume. Each market sheds a unique light on a different part of the crypto ecosystem: 1) ETH activity, the cornerstone of smart contract networks; 2) stablecoin markets, and 3) the relationship between the two largest crypto assets.

USDC/WETH

The USDC/WETH market is the predominant blue-chip stablecoin/ETH pair and the best indicator for ETH trading activity. It’s worth noting that the USDT/WETH pair is also very active on Uniswap. In fact, it is the second most actively traded market. Demand for these three tokens is particularly high on Uniswap as most trades are denominated in those assets, which makes those markets the central routing point for market activity.

Total USDC/WETH V3 transaction volume for Q1 2022 amounted to $81.5 billion, an increase of 6.3% from the previous quarter. The majority of the increase came from the 0.05% fee tier, which jumped from $65.8 billion to $73.2 billion. The increase was partially negated by the decline in trading in the higher 0.30% tier. This trend highlights how competitive exchanges are. As noted in the Q4 2021 iteration of this report, capital competes with capital for fees and ultimately drives trades towards lower fee tiers.

Dividing the total fees by each dollar of liquidity highlights the yields an LP can expect to earn. A quick, high-level comparison of return on assets between the USDC/WETH V2 and V3 pools shows how much more capital efficient V3 is. V2 returns $0.04 for each dollar deposited, or 4.0%; the same calculation for V3 returns $0.12 for every dollar, or 12%. Note this doesn’t account for each V3 LP’s concentrated liquidity, but holistically summarizes V3’s ability to generate a 3x higher return on its liquidity.

Although Polygon found plenty of success in Q1, Arbitrum has a significant amount of liquidity available for USDC/WETH V3. Arbitrum has $16.2 million, i.e., 28.3% more liquidity than Polygon at $12.6 million. Because Arbitrum has been around longer, Polygon’s liquidity has recently grown at a faster daily rate — and it will be supercharged even more with Polygon’s liquidity mining program going live next quarter.

USDC/USDT

Uniswap was not competitive in the stablecoin DEX market until the implementation of its 0.01% trading fee tier. Once that became active, Uniswap could draw the attention of traders looking to pay the cheapest fees on highly correlated stablecoin pairs. The visual above clearly shows when that occurred.

Stablecoin trades in the USDC/USDT market jumped 60% overall against Q4 2021. This followed a 114.1% increase compared to Q3, more than tripling in nine months. Unsurprisingly, 87.3% of trading volume, or about $8.5 billion, came from the lower 0.01% fee tier. Liquidity, meanwhile, only increased 11.2% over the quarter.

In last quarter’s report, we wrote about Uniswap’s decision to implement the 0.01% fee tier as a boost for stablecoin trading volume. Analyzing the data above, Uniswap does appear to now be more competitive with Curve as a result of its enhanced capital efficiency.

Prior to the launch of V3, Uniswap was doing a median of 8.54% of the combined volume between Uniswap and Curve. After the launch of V3, but prior to the implementation of the 0.01% fee tier, Uniswap stablecoin trading across both V2 and V3 operated at a median of 30–33% trading dominance. That median ratio now stands at 48.3% today, practically on parity with Curve. Uniswap’s share of the two combined DEX’s volume even reached a high of 71.4% on one day. Given the importance of stablecoins in the DeFi ecosystem, Uniswap’s gains in this area are exciting to watch.

WBTC/WETH

Trading volume of the WBTC/WETH V3 pool fell 20.2% compared to Q4 2021. Notably, volume in the 0.05% pool fell 28.9% while volume in the higher 0.30% fee tier was mostly consistent across quarters. Liquidity in the smaller fee tier did jump 57.3% whereas the higher fee tier only moved up 13.7%. Since investor sentiment has noticeably cooled, some investors might be choosing to take a yield-generating LP position, earn fees on these (more stable) blue-chip assets, and re-evaluate the state of the market when better opportunities arise.

Behind the scenes, Ethereum continues to show signs of losing its complete dominance of V3 trading. Over the last four quarters, the share of transaction activity occurring on Ethereum has gone from 100.0%, to 99.8%, to 98.4%, and finally, 96.4% in Q1 2022. Once again, the emergent winner in Q1 2022 continues to be Polygon. The WBTC/WETH protocol dominance level for Polygon shows the network starting at around 5% of all trading activity and peaking to 10% midway through the quarter. In total, the 3.6% gain by Polygon and other blockchains isn’t earth-shattering, but it will be something to track as users continue to move towards cheaper scaling solutions.

Grant Program

Uniswap approves grants almost every week, but to avoid publishing a blog post for each new funding, grants are batched together into waves. In Q1 2022, Uniswap released Wave 6 and Wave 7 of their Uniswap Grants Program. Note, the quarter in which batches become publicly shared does not necessarily correlate with the quarter they were made (i.e., some grants from the batches may have been funded in Q4 2021).

What stands out from the quarter is the total grant funding distributed in Wave 6. The previous high occurred in Wave 5 with $946,000. Wave 6 was more than a 2.5x increase from this level, equating to $2.4 million of funding. More than $1 million was dedicated to the “RFP and Challenge” category. Some of the most notable grants from Wave 6 and Wave 7 are below:

Other Internet (Governance Experiments) –$1,000,000

Other Internet received a $1 million grant from Uniswap Grants Program to further their research of Uniswap’s open governance. In the summer of 2021, Other Internet completed initial research on the off-chain governance occurring in the protocol’s Discord channels. The additional funding will support a series of action-oriented proposals to strengthen governance practices, many of which will ideally be implemented throughout crypto. Specific deliverables include a redesign of the governance process, a new committee for UGP, and insights into the protocol treasury. Money from this grant is expected to last the upcoming year.

Unigrants Community Analytics Program – $250,000

A quarter of a million dollars was set aside to fund winners of a new analytics-focused program. The objective of the program is to reward UNI token bounties to contributors who could produce analytics for the protocol. The purpose of the program is to use these analytics to further onboard new users into the community. A committee of five individuals, ranging from UGP members to independent analysts, were chosen to review applications and select bounty winners. More information about the Community Analytics Program can be found in the next section.

Team Secret – $112,500

Uniswap Grants Program decided to continue its partnership with Team Secret for the first half of the fiscal year 2022 after the team’s top-three finish at The International, the biggest global DOTA tournament. As announced in June 2021, the partnership includes the team creating educational content around Uniswap and organizing future technology launches. The goal was — and continues to be — aimed toward reaching new audiences, especially those in the digitally native gaming community.

Art Basel (Crypto Onboarding) – $68,500

Funding was provided to set up a crypto booth at the upcoming Art Basel in December 2021. Occurring in Miami, the booth was dedicated to helping event attendees get onboarded with crypto. People were around to assist curious participants on setting up their first wallet, claiming their first event POAP, learning how to get into NFTs, and more. The end result saw over 300 people get onboarded into crypto and the DeFi ecosystem.

As stated prior, the Community Analytics program is designed to encourage more analytics for the growth of the Uniswap community. Multiple rounds of bounties have already occurred from the time the grant was approved till the end of Q1 2022.

Bounty #1: Uniswap on Polygon — Compare the deployment of Uniswap V3 to Polygon with its metrics on Ethereum. Include other DEXs in the analysis. The final product should display growth in a clean dashboard.
Bounty #2: Uniswap V3 LP Behavior — Create a dashboard analyzing LP behavior for Uniswap V3. Given the capital efficiency of the product, Uniswap wanted to better understand the fee tier, volume, and liquidity preferences of LPs.
Bounty #3: Uniswap V2 vs. V3 (L1) – Over any select time frame, provide analytics highlighting key metrics between the use of V2 compared to V3. V3 KPIs should be broken out by Layer-1 so Uniswap can better understand the drivers behind the adoption of its markets.
Bounty #4: Uniswap Governance – Study points of decentralization for Uniswap Governance, including all off-chain and on-chain voting procedures. This bounty was earned by selecting three specific data points and conducting an analysis of all relevant governance factors.

The Community Analytics Program will continue with Round 3, which is currently taking place. Submissions were due on April 1st, 2022. Winners will be announced one week later on April 8th.

Governance Updates

Feb. 14, 2022 — &lt;a href=&#34;https://messari.io/governor/proposal/252348af-cf95-436d-9566-08f2fc6fbc95&#34;&gt;Deploy Uniswap V3 on Harmony [Failed]&lt;/a&gt;

The decision to approve Hermes DeFi with a Uniswap V3 codebase use grant was rejected for not meeting quorum. The proposed idea would have allowed another alternative DEX to use Uniswap’s code to create an AMM on Harmony. Uniswap would, in turn, receive a plethora of benefits, including Hermes token ownership, trading fees, a perpetual trading pool on the AMM, and more. The community’s concerns centered on how this would not have been a native Uniswap app launch, compared to other “Deploy Uniswap to XYZ Blockchain” proposals. Since sentiment was mostly positive, however, the decision to launch on Harmony — either through a third party or natively — might potentially be revisited if a quorum can be met.

Feb. 21, 2022 — &lt;a href=&#34;https://messari.io/governor/proposal/133d04f0-9d18-43b4-bac4-b8d2fdc5a6af&#34;&gt;Fund the Fee Switch Activation [Failed]&lt;/a&gt;

Uniswap’s fee switch mechanism is a known topic of debate. At the heart of the question is when and how Uniswap will activate its famous fee switch to distribute protocol revenue to UNI token holders. This proposal offered to create a fund to oversee the application of the fee switch mechanism for both V2 and V3 pools but was rejected by the community.

March 12, 2022 — &lt;a href=&#34;https://messari.io/governor/proposal/d63fe95c-2775-4b18-978a-0e08a9737127&#34;&gt;Provide Voltz with Uniswap V3 Additional Use Grant&lt;/a&gt;

Proposed back in Q4, the decision to provide Voltz Protocol with the codebase use grant was successfully executed in March 2022. The codebase granted in this vote will be used for Voltz’s new DeFi primitive for the trading of leveraged interest rate swaps. In return for approving this governance measure, Voltz has agreed to offer 1% of its token supply to Uniswap; if the protocol is successful in attracting liquidity, both Uniswap and Voltz stand to benefit.

March 19, 2022 — &lt;a href=&#34;https://messari.io/governor/proposal/1b536e61-d995-4503-acbc-5a2020694e41&#34;&gt;Deploy Uniswap V3 on Celo&lt;/a&gt;

A temperature check gauging interest in deploying V3 on the mobile-first, environment-focused Celo blockchain was passed in March 2022. Included in the proposal, if ultimately passed, will be $10 million in financial incentives, a third of which would be set aside for environmentally friendly assets such as tokenized carbon credits. By approving the temperature check, Uniswap and the Celo Foundation hope to move to a final vote shortly.

March 25, 2022 — &lt;a href=&#34;https://messari.io/governor/proposal/30f90fe0-b8ce-4e57-847e-c3379eee3f33&#34;&gt;Deploy Uniswap to Gnosis Chain&lt;/a&gt;

The community voted to pass another temperature check regarding the deployment of Uniswap V3 to Gnosis Chain. Gnosis Chain recently underwent a rebranding effort from xDai Chain in an effort to grow usage of the network. Part of this proposal would include funding from the Gnosis Chain team in the form of $10 million from the Gnosis DAO ecosystem fund. Money received from the DAO will be allocated for a tailored liquidity mining program intended to attract users. A final vote should follow a similar timetable as the one needed to approve V3’s launch on Celo.

Final Thoughts

Uniswap’s first quarter of 2022 was primarily marked by organic growth on the Polygon network, exploring ways to expand V3 to other networks, and the pullback of overall trading across the larger crypto market. That last point is what community members may find concerning: if less trading activity occurs, won’t that be detrimental to Uniswap?

The answer is a combination of yes and no. Exchanges always want to see healthy trading volume but the reality is Uniswap is well-positioned to deal with any correction in crypto markets. The fact users can enter into LP positions and earn yields suggests an engagement with the protocol will continue. Tracking how the protocol responds to a changing macro investment environment will be at top of mind for the rest of the year.

The framework will enable marketplace and royalty fees generated from the Origin Story marketplace to be distributed to OGN stakers.

Sector Returns

After three consecutive weeks of positive market sentiment, all sectors are underwater this week. Gaming was the biggest loser as it started showing signs of weakening momentum last week. Last week it was the only sector with a negative return, and this week it took the heaviest losses at -13.28%. Web3 was the other category within sector returns that had a double-digit loss week, shedding 9.99%.

Top Assets

Dogecoin (DOGE) was the only asset within the top 10 assets by market capitalization that ended the week with a positive return. The original dog coin went so far as reaching a 29% gain this week at $0.1796 but then giving most of it back, closing the week with a 4.5% return. Avalanche (AVAX) was the laggard of the group, ending the week with a 10.4% decline.

DeFi Assets

It was a very different outcome for the DeFi sector this week compared to last week. Whereas it was the best-performing sector last week, it was among the bottom three this week. Even though the category’s performance was not impressive this week, there was one asset that took the spotlight: Anchor Protocol’s ANC token. The Terra-based lending and borrowing platform saw its token end the week with a 29.5% gain. Impressive considering the rest of the assets in the category finished the week in the red. THORChain (RUNE) was the biggest loser, marking a 17.3% loss for the week.

Smart Contract Platforms

NEAR Protocol stole Waves’ (WAVES) thunder this week as the NEAR token closed with a 24.6% gain, eyeing to break all-time-highs. It was the only asset within the top smart contract platforms by market capitalization sector that ended the week with a positive return. The catalysts behind NEAR’s recent rally are news of a $350 million funding round led by Tiger Global and rumors that NEAR will launch its native stablecoin (USN), an algorithmic stablecoin with a similar mechanism to Terra’s UST and staking APY of 20%. TRON performed the worst within the category and took the last spot with a 13.7% loss.

Currencies

Only two currencies made it above water this week with Dogecoin (DOGE) leading the group and Monero (XMR) securing the second position. As mentioned earlier; Dogecoin’s (DOGE) price went as high as 29% at $0.1796 before returning most of the gains. The dog token ended the week with a 4.5% return. The currencies that did not end the week in positive territory traded fairly close to each other throughout the week, closing within a 6.9% range (BTC at -4.9% and BCH at -11.8%).

Web3

Audius (AUDIO) was the only winner within the Web3 sector this week with half of the assets in the category reporting double-digit losses. The decentralized music streaming platform has been gaining popularity recently, which has been contributing to its appreciation in price. The token saw its price rise as much as 58.7% before returning most of the gains. It was still enough to secure the number one spot with a 10.6% return. Theta (THETA) secured the endmost position with a 16.3% decline.

Gaming

Dvision Network was the clear outperformer of the gaming sector this week as the virtual reality content ecosystem’s DVI token price rose as high as 54% at $0.5799 but subsequently returned most gains. The performance was enough to help keep its spot in the first place and finished the week with a 21.6% return. Axie Infinity enters its second week in a row where the AXS token comes in last, following the hack of its cross-chain bridge.

The price of the sale would be approximately 1.6 million USDC. The rationale for this sale is that the value of the veNFT’s use has lessened. SpookySwap would use the added capital to hire more developers and deepen BOO liquidity.  

Sector Returns

This week marks the third in a row where markets have seen a general positive return with the exception of the gaming sector. The DeFi sector was the best performer of the week, bringing in a return of 13.91%. Next up was the Web3 sector with a return of 10.27%. The gaming sector has been amongst the top performers for the past two weeks, securing multiple double-digit positive return weeks. This week saw a retracement for the sector as it was the only one to end the week on negative territory (-1.27%).

Top Assets

Solana (SOL) was the best performer amongst the top 10 assets by market capitalization this week, securing a 21.3% gain. Avalanche (AVAX) was the next best performer with an 11.4% return. Following closely was Terra (LUNA) which has continued its rally and now currently sits in ATH territory with a weekly return of 10.5%. Ripple’s XRP performed the worst this week and was the only asset to end in a decline within the category (-3.2%).

DeFi Assets

It has been an action-packed week for the DeFi space as the sector continues gaining momentum. Half of the top DeFi assets posted double-digit returns, with only one asset on the red. Leading the charge among the best-performing sector of the week was THORChain (RUNE) which brought a weekly return of 45.7%. The cross-chain liquidity protocol’s asset has seen its price rise more than 277% since its February bottom. The second best performer was Aave (AAVE), which went on a rally following the release of V3, an upgrade that adds support to six blockchains. The lending and borrowing protocol ended the week with a 27.1% return. FRAX was the laggard of the group with a -1.5% return.

Smart Contract Platforms

Wave’s meteoric week comes from the back of three key events surrounding the Layer-1 blockchain. The first is the Waves 2.0 migration, the launch of a $150 million ecosystem fund and a partnership with Allbridge. However, critics have raised concerns regarding the sustainability of the ecosystem, pointing to the fact that the rise in interest in the blockchain was due to the rise in TVL, which was driven by Neutrino (an algorithmic price-stable &#34;assetization&#34; protocol built on top of Waves) buying up WAVES. Waves (WAVES) closed the week with a 155.0% gain. Cosmos (ATOM) took the last spot with a -3.2% loss.

Currencies

The top currencies sector posted the narrowest set of returns of the week, with returns within a 17.7% range. Leading the sector was Stellar (XLM) with a 10.2% return, the only asset within the category with a double-digit gain. Monero (XMR) was next up with a 4.2% return, followed by Bitcoin (BTC), returning 3.7% on the week. Zcash underperformed compared to the rest of the group, securing the last spot with a 7.5% loss.

Web3

Filecoin (FIL) was on track to post a +35% return this week but at the last moment gave some of those returns back. It was enough to bring the open video infrastructure asset to compete with Theta Network (THETA) for the first spot. Filecoin ultimately secured the spot for the best performer with a 26.2% return while Theta Network (THETA) ended the week with a 23.9% return. Helium (HNT) took the last spot of the group with a -3.2% return.

Gaming

Smooth Love Potion (SLP) was the best performer of the gaming sector this week, bringing in a 13.3% return for the week. Close by was Enjin (ENJ) which posted a weekly gain of 12.2%. Ultra (UOS) took the third spot with a 9.8% gain. Axie Infinity (AXS) took the last spot this week as it posted a loss of 11.9%, mainly driven by the news surrounding the Ronin bridge hack in one of the largest crypto exploits to date.

            <h2>Filecoin Has It: An Ecosystem Overview</h2>
            <div class="content">This report is also available in Japanese and Chinese.

Key Insights

Filecoin offers decentralized storage and cloud services on a global, open market. It has the largest market share in terms of used storage and network capacity.
The ecosystem has grown to over 330 projects up from ​​40 at the start of 2021. Various use cases have emerged, including NFTs, Web3, gaming, metaverse, and audio/video.
Filecoin aims to offer the foundation for data-intensive Web3 services through verifiable storage, content retrieval, compute, and programmable apps coming to the fore.
The main challenge for Filecoin is to pass the test of time and prove its reliability.

Data Availability and Integrity

Almost every Internet user relies on centralized services to store and process data. This has two major shortcomings: users are no longer in full control of their data, and it is hard to verify the integrity of the data. To address these shortcomings, a new generation of protocols and peer-to-peer networks have enabled decentralized storage and cloud services. One prominent protocol of this kind is Filecoin, which provides a cryptoeconomic guarantee that the data exists and can be accessed at any time. 

Put simply, Filecoin is a peer-to-peer version of AWS that regularly verifies data availability and integrity. This is made possible by deals negotiated on open markets for data services.

Deals in Open Markets

A storage deal is like a service level agreement (SLA) enforced on the Filecoin blockchain. Storage deals are agreements where users pay fees to storage providers to store their data. The terms of the deal include the fee amount and the duration of the storage deal.

The open-market environment incentivizes storage providers to offer their storage capacity in an efficiently priced way. That is, prices are determined by supply and demand dynamics, rather than a fixed pricing structure. To incentivize storage providers to participate in deals, Filecoin rewards them with the network&#39;s native token (FIL).

Filecoin has two functions to keep data safe. First, it uses a cryptoeconomic guarantee that verifies the storage with zero-knowledge proofs. Second, it uses an economic penalty: if the data is unretrievable or the storage fails, storage providers are penalized through locked-up collateral. To enforce this, the Filecoin protocol requires storage providers to submit two ongoing verifiable cryptographic proofs. Proof of Replication first verifies that the data has been fully replicated. Upon success of this initial check, storage providers use Proof of Spacetime every day to prove that a random piece of data is still stored and available for retrieval throughout the deal’s lifetime. Any failure leads to a penalty.

To retrieve data, users pay a retrieval provider to fetch the data for them. Unlike storage deals, which are handled on-chain, retrieval deals may happen off-chain. This results in a faster data retrieval process.

Technology in a Nutshell

Filecoin is built on top of the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), which serves as the Filecoin network’s distributed data storage and sharing layer. Although some people use Filecoin and IPFS interchangeably, there are important differences between the two.

Put simply, IPFS is like torrents on steroids. Similar to torrent trackers, IPFS uses a fingerprint of the data. Unlike torrents, IPFS leverages a single global peer-to-peer network. IPFS essentially tells users where their data is, but it lacks a built-in mechanism to incentivize data storage, which led to the development of Filecoin in the first place. Filecoin thus complements IPFS and facilitates an open market for storage with a guarantee, essentially making Filecoin the incentive layer of IPFS.

IPFS may be regarded as a peer-to-peer version of HTTP, with an important twist. Traditional URLs and file paths identify a file by its specific geo-location on a server. IPFS uses content addressing to store data decentrally. It references a file by what’s in it, i.e., by its content. A content address is unique and is the result of hashing, which is essentially the cryptographic compression of content into a long string of characters. When retrieving a file, the network only needs the file’s hash to locate the nodes storing that file’s content.

Network Dynamics

Thanks to its open-market policy and incentive mechanisms, Filecoin has been able to attract significant storage capacity. Regardless of market conditions, Filecoin’s committed storage capacity has grown steadily since 2020 to over 16,000 PiB, which is equivalent to approximately 65,000 copies of Wikipedia or 1,600 Netflix movie archives as of March 2022. The network capacity comes from over 3,900 decentralized storage providers distributed around the globe.

What’s the Demand for Filecoin?

Demand for Filecoin comes from both Web2- and Web3-specific storage use cases. Adding up how much storage capacity is bound in deals quantifies the demand for Filecoin. However, when analyzing the underlying content in the storage deals, it is difficult to distinguish between useful storage and generated randomness as a way for storage providers to abuse the network.

To increase the amount of useful storage capacity on Filecoin, the Filecoin Plus incentive program was developed. The program incentivizes storage providers to participate in verified deals by increasing their share of the block rewards over time.

Storage deal inflows grew from 400 TiB in October 2020 to over 7,600 TiB in March 2022, and Filecoin Plus clearly contributed to that growth. Since Q4 2021, there has been a transition from Filecoin Regular deal inflows (unverified data) to predominantly Filecoin Plus verified deal inflows.

Used storage on the network (i.e., active storage deals) has grown steadily from 0.25 PiB (1 PiB = 1024 TiB) in October 2020 to 45 PiB in March 2022. As shown below, over 26 PiB have resulted from Filecoin Plus deals, representing 57% of the total active deals on the network. 

The recent flippening of Filecoin Regular deals by Filecoin Plus deals indicates that the verified data incentive mechanism is working as planned. The sudden drop-off in terms of active Filecoin Regular deals in December 2021 was a result of several storage providers going offline. The loss has been compensated by other storage providers picking up and contributing to the growth in Filecoin Plus active deals as of January 2022. As a result, the total deal volume fully recovered.

While supply vastly exceeds demand, storage capacity is only one side of the story. What is equally important is the amount of used storage on a network. With 45 PiB of used storage and 16,000 PiB of storage capacity, Filecoin has a storage utilization ratio of 0.3%. To put these network metrics into perspective, competing decentralized storage providers, like Sia and Storj, have 6 PiB and 14 PiB, respectively, of network capacity. Total storage usage by Sia and Storj stands at 2.2 PiB and 8.6 PiB, respectively. In terms of storage utilization ratio, Sia and Storj surpass Filecoin at 36% and 60%, respectively. Although Arweave has 0.05 PiB of data stored, it has not been included since its data stored is negligible compared to the other storage networks: while it is currently growing from a relatively small base, it does not have network capacity per se.

While the introduction of the Filecoin Plus program is a step forward, there is a concerted effort to incubate new businesses and use cases for building on Filecoin. The Filecoin ecosystem is channeled towards onboarding a large variety of use cases: from decentralized storage for NFTs, to music and video streaming, to metaverse and gaming.

Ecosystem of Developers and Builders

Filecoin is actively supported by several organizations with the common goal of growing the Filecoin ecosystem. These organizations come together to form the Ecosystem Working Group. The responsibilities of the Ecosystem Working Group participants include maintaining and upgrading the underlying protocols, supporting the growth of the ecosystem, and facilitating governance. The most prominent organizations in the group include Protocol Labs, Filecoin Foundation, and Outercore. An overview of the main participating organizations is shown below.

These organizations have been actively developing a funnel of developers and builders through activities such as hackathons, accelerators, grants, mentorship and growth support. The funnel is designed to help early-stage projects and teams get to the point where they are ready to receive funding and investments. As a result, over 330 projects are currently being built on Filecoin and IPFS. Below is a breakdown of the funnel, showing projects’ progression over time, grouped by their maturity stage.

The main objective for 2022 is to enable as many early-stage projects in the ecosystem to translate into full-fledged businesses -- i.e.,  advancing from initial stages all the way through Series D and beyond.

As a whole, the ecosystem has grown significantly in terms of integrations with applications and clients, tools for developers, and infrastructure. Recently, the Ecosystem Working Group has prioritized making it easier for end-users and developers to work with Filecoin. This has led to the development of services like Textile Powergate, Estuary, and NFT.Storage. All use cases in the Filecoin ecosystem are available here. A map of selected ecosystem players is shown below.

In terms of notable initiatives in 2022, the forthcoming launch of the Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM) is worth highlighting. FVM is set to unlock programmable storage primitives (e.g., storage bounties, auctions), cross-chain interoperability bridges (e.g., to Ethereum, Solana, NEAR), data-centric DAOs, as well as Layer-2 solutions (such as reputation systems, data availability sampling, computation fabrics, and incentive-aligned Content Delivery Networks).

Main Use Cases Leveraging Filecoin

The Filecoin ecosystem is large and rapidly expanding, positioning itself to become the backbone of the decentralized web. With the rising demand for cloud storage, Filecoin provides a decentralized alternative to the popular centralized platforms. Numerous additional use cases have emerged, and new ones are guaranteed to materialize in the near future. Four major categories have already found high demand: (1) NFT and Web3 storage, (2) permanent storage and Web2 datasets, (3) metaverse and gaming, and (4) audio and video.

NFT Storage

During the summer of 2021, NFTs entered the mainstream spotlight. Driven by network effects, NFTs dominated the crypto landscape in the form of social media profile pictures, fine art, collectibles, music, and more. Interestingly, a large number of NFTs generally point to off-chain storage locations for their metadata since storing it on-chain isn’t feasible. Shortly after the 2021 hype, it became evident that a large portion of NFT metadata was not being stored in a decentralized, immutable manner, putting the content and value of the NFTs at risk. To address this shortcoming, NFT.Storage was developed.

NFT.Storage utilizes Filecoin and IPFS to provide a simple decentralized storage solution specifically for NFT content and metadata. It focuses on perpetual redundant storage through dedicated IPFS servers managed by NFT.Storage and Filecoin. By participating in the Filecoin Plus incentive program, NFT.Storage is able to offer an unlimited amount of storage for NFTs, free of charge.

Launched in April 2021, NFT.Storage has already supported the permanence of over 40 million uploads of NFT data, totaling up to more than 260 TB of data. The simplicity of the service has allowed a wide range of users from individual artists to large marketplaces such as OpenSea, MakersPlace, MagicEden, Holaplex, Jigstack, and Galaxy to take advantage of perpetual NFT storage.

Web3 Storage

Filecoin aims to become the storage layer of Web3. To that end, Filecoin has ongoing collaborations and storage bridges with various major blockchains and smart contract platforms. One of the most recent examples is &lt;a href=&#34;https://messari.io/article/polygon-a-multi-sided-approach-to-zk-scaling&#34;&gt;Polygon&lt;/a&gt;. The goal of the partnership is to meet the storage and infrastructure needs of developers for games and NFT-related Web3 projects. Notably, Polygon developers can easily use Filecoin through the storage bridge. Filecoin has also seen growing traction in the Solana ecosystem with a number of protocols and NFT marketplaces offering native support, including Metaplex, Magic Eden, and Holaplex.

To simplify building Web3 apps on Filecoin, the team launched Web3.Storage. It allows developers to store and retrieve data directly on Filecoin instead of dealing with complex decentralized storage networks. 

Web3.Storage uses redundancy to store data across multiple Filecoin miners and geographically-distributed nodes on IPFS. These IPFS nodes are run by the Web3.Storage team. In addition, the service offers free storage indefinitely with unlimited data. This is made possible by the economics of the Filecoin Plus mechanism. Overall, Web3.Storage has experienced steady growth since its launch, growing from 3 million uploads in August 2021 to 16 million in March 2022.

Permanent Storage &amp; Web2 Datasets

Similar to Arweave, Lighthouse allows Filecoin users to permanently store files for a fixed price. In addition, the Filecoin Virtual Machine will enable permanent storage to be automated into smart contracts. A prominent use case for permanent storage is data archival. Given Filecoin’s scale, the goal is to make archival storage as cost-effective as possible — essentially becoming a commodity for developers building apps on top of Filecoin. This enables the information layer for humanity to be created and preserved. 

The Shoah Foundation is an essential project that archives testimonials from genocide survivors. When it comes to large public datasets, the Internet Archive project stores websites and documents for public access using Filecoin. In addition, Zarr and GainForest store big public datasets with the goal of preventing natural catastrophes related to climate change. The Zarr project makes climate data available to researchers for analysis at scale. GainForest leverages satellite images to combat the effects of climate change.

Metaverse and Gaming

There is a new generation of metaverse and gaming use cases leveraging Filecoin and IPFS. The underlying common aspect of these use cases is user monetization. In this sense, Blockbets and Gala Games support revenue generation and payouts for gamers. When it comes to artist monetization, Mona supports artists displaying their high-end creations in virtual spaces and selling them to collectors. Metaverse AI takes human interactions to the next level: it allows gamers to play and monetize their interactions with other AI-powered virtual humans inside the game.

Audio and Video

Recently, several audio and video applications leveraging Filecoin and IPFS have gained substantial traction. Take, for instance, the Web3 alternatives to Spotify or SoundCloud. Audius is a music streaming service that looks and feels like SoundCloud, but leverages IPFS. Currents.fm and Inflow Music support communities of music creators and curators. Huddle01 could be the next Zoom. It’s a low-bandwidth video conferencing platform tailor-made for remote meetings, with a focus on NFT communities.

Regular users may not be able to tell that Audius, Currents.fm, Inflow Music, or Huddle01 are decentralized or that they specifically leverage Filecoin and IPFS. Nonetheless, there is an ongoing shift towards &lt;a href=&#34;https://messari.io/article/the-nft-effect-on-the-music-industry&#34;&gt;Web3 streaming applications&lt;/a&gt; without users necessarily noticing it.

As the Filecoin ecosystem matures, more use cases are constantly being discovered. The development of the Filecoin Virtual Machine will unlock previously impossible use cases, creating a whole new class of use cases.

Conclusion

While decentralized storage is still in its early days, the Filecoin ecosystem has been thriving over the years. Filecoin and IPFS have been leveraged by a wide range of use cases, including NFTs, Web3, gaming, metaverse, and audio/video. Alongside Filecoin, alternatives like Arweave, Storj, and Sia could use the foundation of IPFS at scale. 

The adoption of decentralized storage solutions and the integration of smart contracts built on top may open the door to novel applications. A significant milestone would be getting major browsers to adopt IPFS. Open data initiatives and decentralized compute may enable the next generation of applications beyond storage. 

The main challenge for Filecoin is to prove its reliability as a storage provider and as an enabler of data-intensive Web3 services. Filecoin and IPFS operate at the cutting edge of the Web3 paradigm and offer an essential foundation for Web3 development. Their success depends on the Web3 applications building on those protocols.

            <h2>Osmosis: Diffusing Liquidity Across the Cosmos Ecosystem</h2>
            <div class="content">Key Insights

Osmosis is a decentralized exchange built on its own sovereign, interoperable Layer-1 blockchain in the Cosmos ecosystem
It was the first app-chain to see significant IBC transfer volume and kickstarted DEX activity in the ecosystem
Notable features of the DEX include highly customizable pool parameters, superfluid staking, and plans to incorporate MEV resistance into its underlying architecture
The protocol is powered by the native OSMO token, which can be used for staking and governance. OSMO rewards are also issued via liquidity incentives for LPs

Introduction

Investors’ belief in a multichain world as an answer to blockchain’s scaling problems has drawn interest towards the Cosmos Network ecosystem, where an “Internet of Blockchains” exists to accommodate a universe of independent, sovereign app-chains. Each app-chain in the network functions as its unique Layer-1 blockchain designed to add to the functionality of the Cosmos Network.

To connect such an ecosystem of blockchains, a healthy financial exchange is necessary. Through these exchanges, capital allocators gain the liquidity to foster a healthy market, invest in growth projects, and drive investment to promising opportunities. The Cosmos Network supports its own native DEX, but it is the Osmosis Protocol that leads the pack in terms of liquidity, trading volume, and fees. In this report, we’ll take a look at Osmosis and understand the features that make it stand out compared to other like-minded automated market makers (AMMs) in this multichain world.

Overview of Osmosis

Background

Osmosis is an Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC)-supported DEX in the Cosmos ecosystem. It was founded in January 2021 by Sunny Aggarwal, Josh Lee, and Dev Ojha, with the parent company Osmosis Labs being responsible for code development.

The co-founders each share experience working in the blockchain space. All three began at Tendermint, known for its byzantine-fault tolerance consensus engine. During that time, they worked on the underlying architecture of the Cosmos ecosystem and afterward split to work on various projects including the Keplr wallet. It was during this time they rejoined to start Osmosis, with the intention of building a fully-customizable DEX.

How Osmosis Works

On a functional level, Osmosis operates similarly to other AMMs. Liquidity pools lock tokens into a smart contract that self-executes trades via token swaps. Counterparties to traders come in the form of liquidity providers (LPs), who provide the underlying tokens, i.e., liquidity, to those pools. In return, those LPs receive designated LP tokens denoting their contribution to the pool, thereby measuring a share of the accrued fees generated. All traditional stuff.

Furthermore, like many other AMMs, Osmosis relies on a deterministic pricing model to ensure the respective weights of tokens in each pool remain consistent. In fact, almost all AMMs use deterministic pricing because it helps determine the number of tokens in each trade. Although market pricing of any token may change, opportunities for arbitrageurs are minimized when the underlying pricing formula is maintained.

Liquidity Incentives

To ensure abundant liquidity, the DEX institutes two mechanisms to help institute long-term viability: bonded liquidity gauges and exit fees.

Longtime DeFi users may recognize the former as traditional liquidity incentives. The mechanism for bonded liquidity gauges is simple: LPs who add liquidity to a pool for a minimum period of time are rewarded with the native OSMO tokens.

LPs can choose the period of time for which they willingly want to bond their tokens. The exact amount of OSMO rewards earned depends on the length of bonding time and the number of bonded tokens, all decided by protocol governance. Interestingly, not all pools receive rewards either; OSMO holders decide which pools earn liquidity incentives. Certain pools receive “allocation points,” and subsequent OSMO rewards are issued proportionally based on each pool’s points count.

Fortunately for the pools without internal incentives, OSMO tokens are not the only eligible rewards. External incentive providers, such as those traded within a pool, are able to distribute their own rewards. Just as with internal liquidity incentives, the external provider chooses which variables to set, such as the time needed for eligibility or the number of rewards.

Exit Fees

If bonded liquidity gauges are the carrot for long-term liquidity, exit fees are the stick. When LPs withdraw capital from liquidity pools, a small fee is charged in the form of LP tokens. This exit fee is determined by the pool creator and is designed to benefit the remaining contributors of the pool, seeing as the exit fee is burned. In total, when LPs decide to withdraw their liquidity, they get back their initial capital plus accrued transaction fees minus exit fees and impermanent loss.

Traction

Notably, Osmosis was the first IBC-enabled DEX in the Cosmos ecosystem. Although other DEXs such as Gravity DEX and Injective Protocol now exist, Osmosis was the first Cosmos-based app-chain to see a high volume of IBC transfers. Due to its first-mover advantage, Osmosis continues to rank first in IBC transactions and second in total transactions, behind the Terra ecosystem.

Osmosis has benefited from the growing interest in the Cosmos ecosystem. Total trading volume and locked liquidity have both been on the rise since its launch. In fact, both metrics saw all-time highs within the last 30 days. And given past Osmosis activity or ownership of the OSMO token as a rumored qualifier for airdrops in the Cosmos ecosystem, there are no immediate signs of slowing down.

Protocol Features

Liquidity Pool Customization

Much of the inspiration behind Osmosis came from an Ethereum-based DEX, Balancer, and its ability to offer multi-asset liquidity pools. In the eyes of the Osmosis Labs team, blending assets into liquidity pools was the first of many customizable options. Through this level of customization, the role of the DEX evolved from only being able to trade spot-priced assets to be able to support an options market, interchain staking, and more.

Osmosis pools offer flexible market-maker functions. Unlike Uniswap’s constant product, Balancer’s constant mean, and Curve’s hybrid functions, Osmosis’s functions are variable, thus realizing its goal of becoming an “AMM laboratory.” The DEX encourages liquidity providers to experiment with different market-making functions of their own choice. Osmosis spurs increased experimentation because new variations can ultimately lead to innovative solutions for reducing slippage or impermanent loss costs.

Pool parameters, including swap costs, initial token weights, and time-weighted average price calculations, are set by the pool’s original creators. However, all Osmosis pools are self-governing by LP token holders. Voting power is distributed in accordance with fractional ownership of the capital in the pool. Longer capital commitments receive a boost in voting share. Since Osmosis expects the market to determine optimal capital efficiency, self-governing pools are merely another parameter to tweak to build the most competitive liquidity pool. The end game is a competitive market that provides greater skin-in-the-game for capital allocators.

Superfluid Staking

Compared to a rollup-centric ecosystem like Ethereum’s, multichain ecosystems like the Cosmos ecosystem face the challenge of bootstrapping their own security. Thus, for Zones in the Cosmos ecosystem, the issue of bootstrapping security becomes of utmost essence.

Osmosis has designed a clever solution for this problem: superfluid staking. Considered one of the biggest advancements in proof-of-stake since liquid staking, this staking method allows LPs to provide liquidity with their native OSMO tokens while simultaneously using those same tokens to bring security to the underlying network. A visual representation of the Osmosis superfluid staking platform is below.

The superfluid staking model &lt;a href=&#34;https://messari.io/article/the-superfluid-evolution-of-stake&#34;&gt;flips existing liquid staking solutions upside down&lt;/a&gt;. Instead of providing liquidity to a bonded asset, superfluid staking takes bonded liquidity from an asset and stakes it to the network. The fact the asset is already bonded to local liquidity pools only helps simplify the network’s balance between security and economic liquidity.

Whitelisted liquidity pools are the only ones eligible to participate in superfluid staking. That’s because Osmosis wants to limit the minting of risky assets by malicious actors who can then drain staked liquidity pools for the underlying OSMO token. Preventing this from happening is crucial for strong security, and the decision to determine whitelisted pools are eligible is left up to Osmosis governance.

The benefit of superfluid staking should be clear: it allows LPs to double their rewards through yields generated from trading fees and through staking rewards for securing the network. Meanwhile, the underlying network benefits from the extra security, leading to a win-win situation for all parties. Even more exciting, Osmosis doesn’t have to be the only beneficiary. The protocol can offer staking-as-a-service to help other app-chains bootstrap their security too. The end result is a mesh network of intertwined security backed by this superfluid staking feature.

CosmWasm Integration

In early March, Osmosis announced it had successfully worked with blockchain devtool company, Confio, to integrate the CosmWasm inter-blockchain smart contract engine into the Osmosis Protocol. By doing so, Osmosis can now access an untapped pool of resources because CosmWasm hosts one of the largest developer ecosystems outside of Ethereum and Solana.

CosmWasm offers a WebAssembly virtual machine (Wasm) for developers familiar with Go and Rust. Developers receive a toolset to build new permissioned smart contracts which can run across multiple Cosmos SDK blockchains. Think of it as a framework intended to boost interoperable smart contract functionality between various Cosmos app-chains.

The announcement potentially hints at additional features coming to Osmosis, such as yield aggregators, liquidity management tools, and more. While this is exciting news for those looking to maximize yields, the Osmosis Labs team has made it clear its end goal is to remain an interoperable DEX-focused protocol – with additional bits and pieces from other contributors.

MEV Resistance

Osmosis’s upcoming roadmap includes the tackling of maximum extractable value (MEV), one of the largest challenges seen in decentralized transactions. Since all trades are facilitated through the blockchain – meaning they’re available on the public ledger – miners are able to rearrange transactions within their block to their own benefit. Miners would have an advantage over ordinary users in situations where it is important to get a transaction approved first, such as for front-running trades or acquiring a prized NFT. This type of MEV behavior disadvantages DEX users in favor of those with privileged access to the blockchain.

MEV originated as a privacy issue only to evolve into a financial one. According to MEV Explore, over $600 million has been extracted away by miners since January 2020 on Ethereum alone.

Osmosis’s solution to MEV is to implement a form of encryption called threshold cryptography.

The process for threshold cryptography begins before transactions hit the mempool. Encrypted transactions hide transaction details from validators, preventing validators from figuring out which transactions to prioritize first. Only after the transactions are finalized and executed can validators see the details. Note that only the trade detail is encrypted during this process; the fee amount will continue to remain public. As a result, pending transactions continue to get added to the blockchain in order of fee amount.

OSMO Tokeneconomics

As the native governance token, OSMO is behind all the features of the Osmosis app-chain. A maximum supply of 100 million tokens will be set in circulation daily epoch-based issuances. The emissions schedule is similar to Bitcoin’s famous “halvening,” except Osmosis will follow a “thirdening” schedule, reducing the number of new tokens by a third every year. The tokens applicable for issuance will be split among staking rewards, developer vesting, community pool allocations, and liquidity mining incentives. The full supply curve schedule can be found below.

The OSMO token launch was a fair launch distributed across airdrop recipients and the protocol’s strategic reserve. Notably, 50% of the supply was airdropped to ATOM holders, and the remaining 50% was set aside for a strategic reserve, which will support the ongoing development of the protocol. The reserve tokens could be used to fund open-source projects, make investments, or provide grants.

Conclusion

Competition for transaction volume is fierce. At the end of the day, successful applications must continuously innovate to keep attracting liquidity providers. The Osmosis community believes the exchange has a strong chance to corner the market. With its position as a multichain centerpiece, status as a host to flexible pool parameters, reputation as a staking innovator, and exciting MEV-resistant roadmap, Osmosis is prepared to capture a significant amount of liquidity and protocol revenue. Only time will tell how successful it’ll be – but early indicators look promising.

            <h2>Oasis Network: Growing a Responsible Data Economy with Privacy</h2>
            <div class="content">Key Takeaways

The Oasis Network is designed to be a privacy-focused, scalable, Proof-of-Stake (PoS) Layer-1 smart contract platform that is Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible.
The network&#39;s value proposition is its multi-layer modular architecture that enables the scalability and flexibility to deploy low-cost privacy-focused smart contracts.
Given the size of the Layer-1 smart contract economy, there is a significant opportunity for the network to accrue value.
The launch of the Emerald ParaTime and the resulting launch of DeFi applications sparked noticeable network activity at the beginning of 2022.
Launching the Cipher ParaTime in Q2 2022 is anticipated to bring Oasis Network&#39;s confidential smart contracts into existence and drive new use cases within DeFi.
The Parcel ParaTime is a set of privacy-first, data governance APIs designed to give users better control of their data and enable developers to deploy an isolated compute environment for privacy-preserving analysis.
A growth strategy consisting of an ecosystem fund, grants programs, developer accelerators, and community initiatives is in place to support ecosystem growth.

The Layer-1 smart contract platform race for market share and adoption turned into an all-out sprint as use cases expanded and alternatives to the Ethereum network experienced exponential growth through the end of 2021. Networks like Terra, BNB Chain, Fantom, and Avalanche witnessed unprecedented growth in average daily network transactions, active daily addresses, market capitalization, and total value locked (TVL). Much of the growth can be attributed to the competitive forces shaping traditional industry strategies that resemble Michael Porter&#39;s Competitive Strategies. Congestion on the Ethereum network, the slow rollout of Layer-2 scaling solutions, the ability to bridge assets cross-chain, and the ability to execute smart contracts on more efficient networks allowed new alternatives to gain a competitive position as differentiated solutions and cost leaders.

While Layer-1 platforms exhibit many fundamental differences, almost all of them aim to solve the blockchain trilemma by attaining adequate decentralization, scalability, and security while hosting smart contracts. While their smart contracts inherit blockchain&#39;s data availability and security, they also inherit its lack of confidentiality. With that in mind, the top Layer-1s do not currently support privacy on their public networks as all records are logged on the blockchain, allowing anyone to read their contents. This presents privacy concerns, due to the possibility of linking ledger addresses to real identities. As adoption grows, users may start to prefer privacy surrounding their activity or sensitive data. This lack of confidentiality, in a sense, could potentially be considered a fourth problem for Layer-1 platforms to solve, and perhaps a &#34;quadrilemma&#34; is on the verge of sparking the next leg of the race towards adoption.

As adoption continues, new platforms with privacy solutions may start to experience the exponential growth realized in the recent past. One such platform, the Oasis Network, is a Layer-1 that aims to solve the trilemma and do so with the flexibility to host privacy-enabled smart contracts. With its unique architecture and deployment of confidential computing technology, the Oasis Network is planting the seeds for growing an open, data-responsible economy with privacy.

Background

The Oasis team was formed in 2018 and consists of contributors from around the globe with diverse backgrounds ranging from start-ups to traditional finance and tech companies. The team also has strong roots in academia. Dawn Song, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, known for her research in computer security and artificial intelligence, is the Founder of Oasis Labs. Oasis Labs is an active member of the Oasis Ecosystem, and one of the early contributors to the Oasis technology. The team raised funds from well-known venture capital firms and investors such as Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), Polychain Capital, Pantera, and Binance Labs, among others, to support the network’s initial development. After the private testnet launch in 2018, the public testnet underwent various iterations alongside bug bounties, audits, and network upgrades before the public mainnet launch in 2020. Fast forward to today, and it has since gone through additional technical developments and an ecosystem expansion that includes a $200 million ecosystem fund while becoming the second-most &lt;a href=&#34;https://messari.io/article/messari-fund-analysis-q4-21-examining-liquid-portfolios-of-crypto-funds?utmsource=newslettertop&amp;utmmedium=organicemail&amp;utmcampaign=fundanalysisq421&#34;&gt;commonly held&lt;/a&gt; asset by crypto funds as of Q4 2021.

At the onset, the Oasis Network was designed to be a privacy-focused, scalable, Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible Proof-of-Stake (PoS) smart contract platform. Its privacy and scalability features are designed to advance DeFi and Web3 by creating a new type of digital asset called Tokenized Data. Unlike existing tokenized data solutions at the application layer, the Oasis Tokenized Data solution is at the network layer, allowing applications to build on top of and harness the benefits of its confidential compute technology. Collectively, the design is intended to allow users to take control of and monetize the private data they generate, thereby incentivizing what Oasis calls a data-responsible economy.

Network Architecture

The Oasis Network utilizes a modular architecture that separates consensus and smart contract execution into the Consensus Layer and the ParaTime Layer, respectively. Both layers are integrated to provide the same functionality of a single network. However, separating these layers allows ParaTimes to process transactions of different complexity in parallel with shared consensus. With this flexibility, workloads and upgrades processed on one ParaTime will work symphonically with consensus to independently ensure network security and finality without impacting other ParaTimes.

Source: Oasis

The Consensus Layer

The Consensus Layer accepts updated state hashes from ParaTimes and writes them into the next block of the Oasis blockchain, while ParaTimes operate as separate networks that can be configured and customized to run specific applications. The network&#39;s two-layer modular solution addresses both security and scalability. While the flexibility to develop ParaTimes in isolation supports scalability, it also enables specific execution solutions such as confidential computation technology to address smart contract privacy concerns.

Source: Oasis

The Consensus Layer is the foundation of the Oasis Network and, in and of itself, is designed around the principles of modularity, which allows for agnostic consensus such that it can be interchangeable with any consensus logic in the future. Currently, the base layer consists of a modified version of Tendermint Core, a Byzantine-Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus engine. It uses a PoS mechanism and a decentralized set of validator nodes and node operators. The validator nodes are randomly selected to form a committee that accepts state hashes from ParaTimes, maintains the public ledger, and ultimately secures the network. The committee&#39;s size dictates the security of the Oasis blockchain and is currently set to 110 validator nodes. Further, unlike most consensus layers, node operators run distinctive types of nodes that are tasked with providing a minimal set of services (e.g., staking and registry) specifically for ParaTime functionality.

The Consensus Layer Beyond Tendermint Core

As the Consensus Layer diagram above illustrates, the multiple layers of consensus begin at the top, with the nodes tasked with providing a minimal set of services. These services range from maintaining epoch-based time-keeping services to coordinating key manager runtimes and storing and publishing policy documents and status updates required for key manager replication. This multi-node architecture aims to reduce complexity and, ultimately, the risk of computational errors at the execution layer.

Further, Tendermint Core consumes consensus logic via the Application Blockchain Interface (ABCI), the interface between Tendermint and a single application. Since the Oasis Network has multiple services that need to be provided by the Consensus Layer, it uses an ABCI application multiplexer which performs some common functions and dispatches transactions to the appropriate service-specific nodes. This is how core consensus is able to interact with each of the service nodes.

Core Layer Staking and Consensus Voting Power

The current voting power mechanism is stake-weighted, which means the consensus voting power is proportional to its stake. In this model, the network will require signatures by validators representing greater than two-thirds of the total stake of the committee to sign a block. Note that in Tendermint, a validator&#39;s opportunities to propose a block in the randomly generated block proposer order are also proportional to its voting power.

Validators must stake a minimum of 100 tokens to contribute to the network&#39;s security. Each registered entity can have at most one node elected to the consensus committee at a time. The chance of being selected for the committee will be proportional to a validator&#39;s stake weight (self-stake amount plus delegated stake).

The network currently targets an inflation rate between 2% and 12%, with validator reward amounts dependent on the length of time staked. To be eligible for staking rewards in a given epoch, a node needs to sign at least 75% of blocks in that epoch.

The network will only slash for double-signing. Double-signing penalties will result in the loss of the minimum stake amount and a frozen node. Freezing the node is a precaution to prevent the node from being over-penalized. The network will not slash for liveness or uptime. Oasis requires a 14-day unbonding period if validators or delegators move their staked funds. During this time, staked tokens are still at risk of getting slashed for double-signing and do not accrue rewards.

The ParaTime Layer

The ParaTime Layer is the smart contract execution layer that consists of multiple, parallel ParaTimes, each representing a computing environment with a shared state. Operating a ParaTime requires the participation of node operators, who contribute nodes to an open or closed compute committee in exchange for rewards. Oasis uses discrepancy detection to verify ParaTime execution. This verifiable computing technique permits the use of smaller committees and requires a smaller replication factor for the same level of security, which, according to Oasis, is more efficient than sharding or parachain models. The two key features include (1) random selection of compute nodes from a population to form a compute committee and (2) only accepting the results if all committee members agree. If there is a discrepancy, a separate protocol called &#34;discrepancy resolution&#34; is enabled, serving as another security parameter. In a sense, smart contract execution functions similarly to the Consensus Layer and its use of node operators and a compute committee. ParaTimes can be operated by anyone and can have their own reward system, participation requirements, and structure; meanwhile, node operators can participate in any number of ParaTimes.

As described previously, the separation from consensus allows the network to address scalability through its modular design. The separation also allows ParaTimes to be different from each other. One difference is the ability to run confidential ParaTimes or non-confidential ParaTimes, with the latter being similar to Ethereum and other alternative Layer-1 networks. Furthermore, ParaTimes can evolve independently while maintaining consensus even as security, scalability, or privacy technologies advance. In other words, the network can maintain a public ledger while having an ecosystem of separate ParaTimes that can evolve with technological advancements, allowing it to adapt and serve future use cases. Beyond confidentiality, Paratimes have the flexibility to configure parameters such as the size of the committee&#39;s performing execution, which relates to the level of security a user needs to satisfy particular business requirements. Further, ParaTimes can run different VMs such as EVM or Rust-based smart contracts and can be designed to be permissioned or permissionless systems. Ultimately, ParaTime customization and flexibility allow developers to strike the desired balance between security, performance, and privacy.

Confidential ParaTimes

Privacy-enabled smart contract execution is one of the core value propositions that Oasis is known for. Cipher, an upcoming ParaTime, will support confidential smart contracts. In a confidential ParaTime, nodes are required to use a secure computing technology called a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE). TEEs are analogous to a black box for smart contract execution. With the use of key management (illustrated in the ParaTime Layer diagram above), encrypted data goes into the black box (i.e., Secure Enclave) along with the smart contract, where the data is decrypted, processed by the smart contract, and then encrypted before it is sent out of the black box. This process ensures that data remains confidential and is not disclosed to the node operator or application developer. Other secure compute technology, such as Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs), can also be used to execute private smart contracts. The interchangeability of secure compute technology is an additional example of modularity and value proposition at the ParaTime Layer.

The ROSE Token

The ROSE token is the Oasis Network&#39;s native token used for transaction fees, staking, and delegation on the Consensus Layer and for smart contract operations that require fees on the ParaTime Layer. The token is also anticipated to be used for network governance, which is currently being modeled to be a hybrid off- and on-chain mechanism whereby changes to the network will be determined democratically by node operators. Voting power is anticipated to be based proportionally on self and delegated stake.

Suppose the network&#39;s value proposition of privacy allows for continued traction. In that case, the token will likely accrue value from increased protocol revenue, the expansion of network infrastructure and node operator stake, and demand for governance stake. The token itself has a fixed supply of 10 billion ROSE. Not all tokens were released publicly on mainnet launch. Due to release schedules and locks, only a fraction (1.5 billion ROSE) of the total existing token supply was introduced into circulation at mainnet launch.

As a percentage of the total existing token supply, the quantity of ROSE tokens reserved for various network functions follows the allocation below.

Backers: Between 2018 and 2020 Oasis raised over $45 million from well-known investment funds that acquired 23% of the total supply cap at network launch.

Source: Oasis

Core Contributors: As compensation to core contributors for contributing to the development of the Oasis Network, 20% of the total supply cap was allocated at network launch.

Foundation Endowment: With the initial 10% allocation of the total supply cap, the endowment to the Oasis Foundation is tasked with developing and maintaining the Oasis Network. A portion of the Foundation tokens not introduced to the circulating supply at launch are staked on the network. Foundation staking rewards go back into the network via validator delegations, network feature development, and ecosystem grants.

Community and Ecosystem: Funding programs and services that engage the Oasis Network community, including developer grants and other community incentives by the Oasis Foundation, initially held 18.5% of the total supply cap.

Strategic Partners and Reserve: Funding programs and services provided by key strategic partners in the Oasis Network initially held 5% of the total supply cap.

Staking Rewards: On-chain rewards are set to be paid out to stakers and delegators for contributing to the security of the Oasis Network. Approximately 2.35 billion ROSE (23.5% of the supply cap) will be paid out as staking rewards to stakers and delegators over four years. Rewards will be disbursed by on-chain mining mechanisms, calculated based on how many blocks are produced, how many nodes are participating in staking, and how many tokens are staked.

The tokens not allocated for staking will be disbursed according to the following 10-year release schedule:

The token supply curve above begins at launch, which occurred in 2020. A rapid increase of unlocked tokens began after 12 months and began to level off recently in the 15th month. In 2024, the token supply release will experience a further leveling until hitting its plateau in the 10th year.

Current State and Glimpse into the Oasis Network Ecosystem

Like many digital assets, the ROSE token has declined in valuation by ~50% year to date (YTD), along with a decline in trading volume across exchanges. The top three trading pairs by volume are trading on Binance (USDT, BUSD, BTC) currently making up ~45% of all ROSE trading volume.

While trading volume has declined, liquidity of the ROSE token is still relatively healthy, with daily trading volume ranging between $100 million to $500 million, equating to ~$125 million in trading volume on average YTD. Though valuation and trading volume metrics have experienced a downward trend, network usage has experienced a noticeable upward trend.

At the beginning of 2022, the Consensus Layer of the network was averaging below 10,000 transactions per day. By the middle of January, transactions grew to greater than 140,000, representing an approximate 2,600% increase. Current daily transactions of 110,000 are outpacing the YTD average of 100,000, which also indicates an upward trend. As of March 15, 2022, consensus consists of 153,000 active addresses and has processed 7 million transactions in the aggregate. Further, Emerald launched this year and has generated as many as 3.8 million transactions in a single day and is averaging about 650,000 transactions per day.

Beyond market data and network usage, the network infrastructure has grown from 100 active validators to 110 and has witnessed evolving decentralization metrics.

Currently, seven validators contribute to just under ~33% of the network&#39;s total stake. The methodology behind the Nakamoto Coefficient assumes 33% is the threshold of total stake needed to compromise a network. The higher the coefficient, the more secure a network is deemed to be as it would require a greater number of validators to collude against the network. Given this methodology, the Nakamoto Coefficient of Oasis is similar to other Layer-1 networks, even though most others launched before Oasis, allowing for more time to decentralize their networks. Only time and adoption will determine the extent Oasis Network grows validator sets and a more diversified distribution of stake.

Ecosystem Overview

There may be a reason why the Oasis Network&#39;s token symbol is ROSE.

Source: Oasis

An oasis is a fertile place in an arid environment. The water it provides turns into a thriving ecosystem of plants and animals. In the same way, the Oasis Network provides the resources for applications to build DeFi services and new use cases. Evaluating Oasis Network&#39;s current state is a starting point for assessing the ecosystem. Given recent developments and anticipated value propositions to come, following along to see whether it succeeds at thriving will be top of mind as we look ahead into 2022.

A key driver of recent growth was the result of launching the Emerald ParaTime. Emerald is the EVM-compatible system essential for Solidity-based smart contract execution. Having EVM compatibility and Solidity support means that any token developed for Ethereum can be migrated through existing bridge infrastructures like Wormhole, cBridge, and Multichain, which also went live earlier this year. Emerald also allows the ERC-20 token standard to run natively on the Oasis Network. Ultimately, the launch of Emerald brought a flurry of DeFi activity to the network, which is reflected in the increase of daily transactions at the beginning of 2022.

DeFi on the Oasis Network

Source: Oasis

Along with Emerald, the network launched DeFi infrastructure including the Oasis Wallet for the ROSE token, and it also integrated with bridges like Multichain. This sparked the network&#39;s first DeFi application, YuzuSwap (YUZU). YuzuSwap is the network’s first community-developed decentralized exchange (DEX) that offers users low-cost trading services. The DEX allocates 20% of all transaction fees to the YUZU DAO where holders of the YUZU token can use those funds to incentivize further protocol growth. Within a month of launch, YuzuSwap exceeded $100 million in TVL and $1 billion in trading volume.

Another major contributor to recent growth is ValleySwap (VS), a DEX that launched as recently as February 24, 2022. The launch of ValleySwap clearly generated a renewed uptrend in network activity at the end of February as daily transactions spiked at that time. As of March 15, YuzuSwap and ValleySwap are producing ~$1–3 million in daily trading volume and have accrued $37 million and $125 million in TVL, respectively.

The third-largest DeFi application on Oasis is Fountain Protocol (FTP), the network’s first lending protocol. It launched with 200,000 FTP in incentives and generated over $7 million in TVL in its first day. Using Fountain, users can experience one-stop management of DeFi assets with high capital efficiency and take advantage of the low-cost Oasis Network. As of March 15, Fountain Protocol is the third-largest DeFi application on the Oasis Network after growing to $17 million in TVL.

With the launch of these DeFi protocols, the Oasis Network not only saw an increase in daily transactions but rapid growth in TVL.

Intuitively, the market cap to TVL ratio declined as the market cap declined by 50%, and TVL increased by 190%. This fundamental ratio represents how a network is valued relative to value locked. If the ratio is a large number, the network value is viewed as being overvalued. In other words, a network with an MCap/TVL below 1 represents a network value that is less than the capital locked in the entire network. Given that the network was carrying a nearly $1 billion market valuation before the launch of DeFi, it makes sense to see such a drastic decline in the ratio after the resulting growth of TVL.

The Ecosystem Beyond Emerald

Oasis Network is launching two additional ParaTimes that go beyond Emerald. The Parcel ParaTime and the Cipher ParaTime. Parcel is the system that stores, governs, and computes confidential data. By integrating Parcel SDK into their applications, developers can incorporate privacy-preserving data storage, governance, and computation. This ultimately serves as the Tokenized Data engine, which can convert any data file into an NFT.

With Parcel, the Oasis Network intends to foster a responsible data society using Tokenized Data. Data providers on the Oasis Network will be able to put their Tokenized Data to use by earning rewards from applications that analyze or control how their sensitive information is used on different services. This concept differs from the data ownership we are familiar with today in that data is not monetized or controlled by those who generate it.

Source: Oasis

Currently, Parcel is a permissioned ParaTime for use by enterprise partners such as Binance, Genetica, and BMW. Binance is one such partner that has engaged with Oasis to combat bad actors across various exchanges. With theft and attacks as prevalent events in crypto, exchanges need a platform to identify and ban bad actors. Oasis and Binance created the CryptoSafe Platform to enable exchanges to share threat intelligence data. Using the network&#39;s confidential compute feature, exchange data can be kept confidential even when compared across exchanges. While Parcel is currently a permissioned network, it is anticipated that it will become permissionless by the end of 2022, bringing Tokenized Data into public reality.

Further, the third piece of the puzzle is the Cipher ParaTime. Cipher is the confidential smart contract system set to launch at the end of Q2 2022. Cipher is a core value proposition of Oasis that will support WebAssembly smart contracts that make confidential compute possible.

When the additional ParaTimes launch, they have the potential to open the network to an ecosystem aimed at privacy-first DeFi, including privacy-preserving decentralized exchanges. To that end, they are designed to make it easier for DEXs to prevent front-running transactions, for NFT users to protect their assets privately, and for them to hypothetically unlock more value from traditional credit and lending markets seeking confidentiality. An example of how DeFi applications can unlock the value of Parcel and Cipher is depicted below.

Source: Oasis

In this example, users will be able to utilize Cipher and a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) to protect their private data while monetizing and disclosing private data to various DeFi services through the power of Parcel.  For example, a user&#39;s risk profile and reputation could be used such that lending services can manage risk and gauge appropriate collateralization requirements. With this knowledge, lending services like Aave could offer under-collateralized lending based on credit-worthy reputations. It will be interesting to track their adoption and usage as the market opportunity for these ParaTimes is substantial. Additional use of these ParaTimes may also generate or supersede the network activity as their Emerald counterpart did in early January.

Competitive Landscape

Compared to the top five protocols by TVL, Oasis metrics may not be as large but represent the market opportunity the network has when compared to other Layer-1 platforms. There are a few other key items to point out. First, Oasis launched its Consensus Layer later than most of the top L1s in existence today. It also didn&#39;t launch its EVM ParaTime until January of this year. Lastly, none of them have confidential compute technology at the center of their ecosystems. Nonetheless, when we evaluate each network over the same period, Oasis experienced greater growth in TVL than each of the top chains. As of March 15, 2022, Ethereum experienced a 23% decline in TVL while Oasis experienced a 192% increase. Although this very well could be the result of the high growth that is usually experienced by any early-stage endeavor, the traction may suggest there is a driver for using and building on the Oasis Network technology.

The key to Oasis closing the gap on its multibillion dollar counterparts may rely on the privacy value proposition on the way. If adoption becomes apparent and the gap closes by even a small percentage, Oasis is poised to capture market position as a privacy-enabled, smart contract platform.

The Road Ahead, Potential Challenges, and Growth Strategy

Like many networks in this highly competitive space, positioning in the market may come with some challenges. The growth of the network infrastructure for additional ParaTimes needs to continue for a successful launch. As with the launch of any network, some potential risks and setbacks could occur due to a lack of infrastructure and decentralization. Given the recently generated network activity from the launch of DeFi, Oasis needs to find strategies to successfully launch additional ParaTimes, maintain growth, and pursue opportunities to close the gap with more mature networks. With that in mind, Oasis does appear to have a strategy to mitigate these challenges. In addition to the anticipated launch of Cipher and Parcel, the Oasis Foundation has engaged with a group of backers that include Binance Labs, Pantera, Dragonfly Capital, and others to pool together more than $200 million in funding for developers and projects looking to build on the Oasis Network. Moving forward, it will be imperative to evaluate the continued growth of Emerald and the launch of Cipher and Parcel in tandem with the capital efficiency of the ecosystem fund.

In addition to the ecosystem fund, the Oasis Foundation has been working with development teams through Grant and DevAccelerator programs to build applications and integrations on top of the Oasis Network. As a result of these programs, there are over a dozen recipients actively building.

Finally, the Oasis Network has implemented a strategy to build community by way of an Ambassador Program and University Program. Oasis seeks to build a global body of ambassadors to run meetups, answer developer questions, and stress test the Oasis Network. The University Program stretches across five continents, with over 25 university departments and blockchain clubs participating. University Program members run nodes and build apps that include Blockchain at Berkeley, Tsinghua University&#39;s Student Association of Digital Finance, and Cambridge University&#39;s Blockchain Society.

Collectively, Oasis has organized an ecosystem fund, grant, accelerator program, and community programs to mitigate network risk by expanding network infrastructure and driving network activity for the foreseeable future.

Closing Summary

The Layer-1 smart contract platform race for adoption and market share is likely far from over as Ethereum continues its architectural redesign and incorporates scaling solutions. New use cases continue to demand alternative solutions, and one of those solutions may very well address the desire for confidential computation technology on a purpose-built, modular execution layer. With its unique architecture and deployment of confidential computing technology, the Oasis Network seeks to meet such a demand. Oasis stands well-positioned to close the gap in the Layer-1 race as the network moves forward with expanding applications on Emerald and launching Cipher and Parcel.

Though technical challenges may present themselves along the way, Oasis is positioned with a growth strategy that includes an ecosystem fund, incentive programs, and community initiatives organized to mitigate such challenges and drive growth. Although many Layer-1s experienced exponential growth in 2021, Oasis was not quite in the race as major developments and launches had yet to occur. To that end, this year is a pivotal year for the Oasis Network, as the network unleashes its value proposition to the decentralized world.

            <h2>Akash: A Decentralized Approach to Cloud Computing</h2>
            <div class="content">Key Takeaways

Outsourcing data storage and compute power to cloud computing providers offers many benefits; however, nearly one-third of server capacity goes unused and a majority of the market share is consolidated among three companies: Amazon, Google, and Microsoft.
Akash addresses the lack of efficiency and centralization in the cloud computing market with a decentralized marketplace that connects entities seeking cloud services to providers eager to rent out their excess compute resources.

  &#34;Cloud computing is a great euphemism for centralization of computer services under one server.&#34; – Evgeny Morozov

Although the old guard of cloud computing uses more than one server, it can still exercise totalitarian power over its data centers, which are full of many servers. With cloud providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure accounting for over 60% of the cloud computing market, most of the internet’s data lives on centralized networks at the behest of only three owners.

Akash Network gives consumers an alternative to centralized cloud providers in its Akash Deployment Marketplace that allows users to set a price they are willing to pay to deploy their software while providers with extra compute power bid to host the user’s application. This marketplace for underutilized computing resources functions very similarly to Airbnb, allowing providers to rent out unused capacity.

On the Importance of Cloud Computing

No one is shielded from the omnipresent cloud. Whether it&#39;s your phone, car, streaming service, or social media accounts, you utilize cloud technology every day. In its simplest form, cloud computing allows you to access services on the internet instead of on your machine.

In the archaic days of DVD players, the only legal way to watch Disney movies was by physically purchasing the DVD and inserting it into the player connected to the television. Watching many movies required purchasing a collection of these discs. The cloud changed the mechanics of this physical interaction while keeping the same product, films. By storing the archived film data and running backend processes of the Disney Plus streaming service on remote servers, Disney eliminated the requirement for users to have product-specific hardware (DVD players) so it could deliver the same product through the internet.

Disney doesn’t just use the cloud to host customer-facing applications like its streaming service. For the operational side of its business, Disney and many other companies use cloud technology for data protection, data analytics, storage backup, server virtualization (virtual machines), and software development. But companies like Disney don’t need to own the server infrastructure that facilitates all of these necessary operations. Instead, most companies outsource server management to cloud service providers.

Before the prevalence of Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure, companies had their own onsite data centers. From hiring IT teams that manage hardware updates and maintenance to purchasing large plots of real estate and paying colossal energy bills, costs related to IT infrastructure would be recorded as capital expenditures. However, paying for cloud computing where the cloud provider absorbs all of the costs associated with IT infrastructure is considered an operational expense, which is tax-advantaged. Although deploying applications to a big three cloud provider comes with monetary benefits and improved operational efficiencies, cloud consumers are locked into vendors and have limited control over their deployments in a centralized cloud environment.

As more enterprises understand the higher levels of scalability, flexibility, and cost-savings they can achieve by outsourcing IT infrastructure to cloud service providers, Gartner predicts that in 2022 end-users will spend $482 billion on cloud services. This is up 54% from the $313 billion spent in 2020. The pandemic’s push for remote-hybrid work is only helping to accelerate the growth of the cloud computing industry. According to Flexera, 92% of U.S. companies already utilize cloud technology, with 90% claiming usage is higher than initially planned due to the pandemic. This is in stark contrast to Europe, where only 42% of enterprises were on the cloud in 2021, up from 19% in 2016.

Despite the rapid growth and prevalence of cloud computing, 30% of server capacity sits idle in many data centers. As the market for cloud computing continues to grow globally, a convergence will emerge among providers seeking to rectify supply-side inefficiencies and enterprises looking for the flexibility to scale their business, outsource IT infrastructure, and avoid the complications caused by centralized entities.

The Akash Marketplace

Akash is an open-source platform with a distributed peer-to-peer cloud marketplace that connects users seeking cloud services to infrastructure providers with excess computing resources. Its platform is used for hosting and managing deployments and contains cloud management services that leverage Kubernetes to run workloads.

These users, called tenants, are typically developers seeking to deploy Docker containers to cloud providers that meet specific criteria. A Docker container essentially contains packaged code, its dependencies, and ensures the corresponding application runs the same on any computing environment. For example, even if the configurations of an application differ when it is developed on a laptop, tested in a sandbox, and sent to the cloud to run, containers can support all three environments without requiring changes to the code.

The Akash marketplace functions through a reverse auction model, giving users the ability to name a price and describe the resources they want for deployed containers. When a cloud provider, which can range from an individual to a data center, underutilizes computing resources, it rents those resources out by bidding to host deployments, in the same way Airbnb hosts can rent out their extra space. Deploying containers on Akash costs roughly 10 times less than any of the big three cloud service providers (Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure).

All records of requests, bids, leases, and settlement payments are stored on-chain using the Akash Token (AKT).

Leadership

Greg Osuri, co-founder and CEO: With a cloud architecture and entrepreneurial background that dates back to 2008, Osuri founded Akash as a decentralized alternative to the traditional cloud computing industry. Before Akash, Osuri founded four other companies and worked at distinguished firms, including Miracle Software Systems as a technical architect, IBM as a critical infrastructure consultant, and Kaiser Permanente as a cloud infrastructure consultant. Osuri’s notable founding projects include AngelHack, one of the most diverse developer ecosystems in the world with over 175,000 developers in 50 cities, and Overclock Labs, Akash’s core contributor focused on making a decentralized and open internet.

Adam Bozanich, co-founder and CTO: Bozanich is a veteran in the software engineering space and has held senior-level roles since 2006. With experience across software development domains, Bozanich worked in QA automation at Symantec, security engineering at Mu Dynamics, and server engineering at Topspin Media. He also co-founded two other companies before Akash: Sprouts Tech and Overclock Labs with Osuri.

Who Runs the Network, Overclock or Akash?

Overclock Labs essentially bootstrapped the Akash Network under the direction of Osuri and Bozanich. Since then, Akash has become a decentralized protocol. Although Overlock is still involved in Akash’s development, it does not control the majority of the 100 validators on the network and, hence, cannot manipulate AKT transactions. Despite its lack of control, Overclock is still Akash’s principal contributor to its open-source codebase, though many contributors come from outside of Overclock.

Since 2020, Akash Network’s GitHub has seen a rise in the commits of contributors not affiliated with Overlock Labs. A commit is an addition or change to the code of any length. Because commits vary in complexity and utility, they can be used as an indicator for developer activity within a given project. Although Overclock continues to account for the majority of Akash’s development, Akash’s own developer community is growing and contributing to the development of the project at an increasing rate.

The Akash Network

The Akash Network built its blockchain on a Cosmos SDK framework utilizing the Tendermint Byzantine-Fault Tolerant (BFT) engine for its Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) consensus algorithm. To simplify the seven or eight buzzwords used in the previous sentence, at its core, Akash uses the Tendermint engine as the security and networking layer of its blockchain. And it uses the Cosmos SDK to customize various aspects of its blockchain, from governance to staking.

Staking AKT in a DPoS Protocol

Because Akash uses a DPoS consensus algorithm, staking responsibilities vary between delegators and validators. Validators operate nodes to secure on-chain AKT network transactions. Although anyone can become a validator, only those with the computing resources and technical expertise to run an Akash node will.

The minimum system requirements that Akash recommends to operate validator nodes include a 4-core CPU, 16GB of RAM (memory), 256GB of SSD (storage), and a Linux Ubuntu OS. Of course, better specifications will equal better performance; regardless, these are relatively modest minimum requirements compared to a blockchain like Solana. On Solana, validators need a 12-core/24-thread CPU, 128GB of RAM at a minimum (256GB RAM suggested), and three separate storage units (recommended) totaling 2 TB (500 GB for accounts, 1 TB for ledger, 500 GB for OS).

The frequency with which the consensus algorithm chooses validators to approve network transactions — and hence, receive inflationary rewards — is in proportion to the amount of AKT the validator stakes. This creates a competitive environment among validators to acquire AKT themselves or from delegators.

Delegators delegate their right to earn validation rewards on AKT to a validator who does the work of running a node. This validator then splits the rewards with the delegator (in proportion to how much they delegated) and takes a commission fee off the top. AKT holders can delegate through the Keplr desktop wallet.

AKT Tokeneconomics &amp; Utility

At genesis, 100 million AKT were distributed to the allocations found in the graphic above, while roughly 289 million AKT were scheduled to be released as inflationary emissions to stakers initially set to a 100% APR meant to halve every two years. Governance voting changed halving to roughly every 3.7 months. According to Akash founder Greg Osuri, the protocol has plans to reward cloud providers with emissions, though the functionality will be implemented at a later date.

The vesting schedules are described below based on the initial allocations of the 100 million AKT at genesis (September 2020):

Investors (34.5% or 34.5 million AKT): roughly 17.3 million AKT released after a one-year lock-up, following a graded vesting schedule unlocking roughly 8.6 million AKT after every six months
Team &amp; Advisors (27% or 27 million AKT): 11 million AKT released after a one-year lock-up, following a graded vesting schedule unlocking six million AKT after every six months
Decentralized Cloud Foundation (19.7% or 19.7 million AKT): one million AKT unlocked at TGE following a graded vesting schedule unlocking roughly 8.9 million AKT after the first month, then roughly 4.1 million AKT after the next six months, then roughly 2.1 million AKT after the following 11 months and after two more six-month periods
Ecosystem (8% or 8 million AKT): 2 million AKT released after a one-month lock-up, following a graded vesting schedule unlocking 1.5 million AKT after the first six months, then after the following 11 months, and then after two more six-month periods
Testnets (5% or 5 million AKT): 800,000 AKT released after a one-month lock-up, following a graded vesting schedule unlocking 1.05 million AKT after the first six months, then after the following 11 months, and then after two more six-month periods
Vendors &amp; Marketing (4% or 4 million AKT): 800,000 AKT released after a one-month lock-up, following a graded vesting schedule unlocking 800,000 AKT after the first six months, then after the following 11 months, and then after two more six-month periods
Public Sale (1.8% or 1.8 million AKT): No vesting schedule

AKT is a utility token with multiple uses in the protocol encompassing security, rewards, network governance, and transactions.

Node operators that validate transactions on the mainnet and receive rewards must have a total stake of AKT that positions them as a top 100 holder among peers. This total stake comes from the amount the validator allocates themself combined with the amount delegated to them. Validators on Akash are not required to stake a minimum amount of their own AKT holdings. Accounting for more AKT increases the odds a node operator will get chosen to validate transactions, thereby increasing the frequency of their rewards. To dissuade malicious/lazy validators, those who do not adhere to the consensus guidelines risk getting a portion of their stake slashed.

Not yet implemented but mentioned in the whitepaper, Akash plans to charge a “take fee” for every successful lease. It would then send the fee to the Take Income Pool to be distributed to holders. The take fee is planned to be 10% for AKT transactions and 20% for when other cryptocurrencies are used. Akash also plans to reward holders for the time lock-up of their AKT holdings. Holders who stake for longer periods of time will be eligible for larger rewards.

Only AKT holders can participate in governance. This includes submitting proposals and voting on them. The cost of submitting a proposal is a non-refundable deposit of 1,000 AKT. For passed proposals that require binary updates(code changes), validators must update the codebase to avoid penalties and continue validating the network.

AKT is the ecosystem’s reserve currency, used for gas fees and as the default medium of exchange in transactions between providers and tenants. The Akash whitepaper describes a settlement option to lock in an exchange rate between AKT and a settlement currency that is meant to counter AKT price volatility in marketplace transactions. This settlement option has yet to be implemented.

Akash’s Continued Development

Akash learned not to develop too far into the future after postponing the development and release of supermini, the home-based miniature supercomputer that would have seamlessly integrated with the Akash Network allowing people to use it for heavy workloads or to rent it out.

With 33 cloud providers supporting 525 active leases at about a 90% discount to traditional cloud computing market prices (due to supply being much higher than demand), Akash is working on ways to unlock market expansion. It plans to improve both its blockchain and cloud marketplace. Developing on both fronts will make Akash’s products more palatable to traditional cloud computing consumers and open the protocol up to wider crypto adoption.

The release of Akash’s Testnet 3 on March 7, 2022, shows that the team is focused on developing new features for the mainnet including:

Persistent storage: Workloads containing large data sets such as blockchain nodes will be able to persist data between restarts. If deployment drops or re-initializes, data will not be lost.
Fractional uAKT: Removes the implicit minimum cost of deployment (one uAKT per block). Fractional uAKT will keep prices more consistent and resource consumption more accurate to the cost.
AuthZ: Users can authorize a wallet to spend a set number of tokens by another source wallet exclusively on deployments. This reduces security concerns when big teams work together on deployments without using large shared wallets. It allows new community members to spin up deployments without access to a faucet.
Inflationary Curve: An automatic curve mechanism that autocorrects when the inflation differs from the plan outlined in the whitepaper. This removes the need for human intervention where governance proposals would need to be quickly submitted to implement a fix.

The full list of developments Akash is planning for 2022 can be found on its roadmap. According to Akash founder Greg Osuri, most of the fourth-quarter deliverables from 2021 have been developed and are still in the process of being implemented into production.

Akash’s target markets, from Web3 to artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML), continue to grow in parallel. As the Web3 crowd seeks decentralized computing infrastructure and the heavy-duty compute crowd seeks low-cost flexible solutions to deploy software, Akash will have many opportunities to meet the demands of the thriving cloud compute user base.

Decentralized Cloud Competition

Akash is not the only blockchain project disrupting the nearly half-trillion-dollar cloud computing market. Other decentralized competitors include Dfinity (Internet Computer), Ankr, and Cudos. Although Ankr launched with a similar model to Akash, today, Internet Computer and Ankr both approach cloud computing from different perspectives. Meanwhile, Cudos nearly replicates Akash.

Dfinity / Internet Computer

While Internet Computer is mostly considered a smart contract platform, it seeks to decentralize everything in its protocol, from the consensus algorithm to the servers the validation nodes connect to when approving network transactions that get broadcasted through the internet.

It’s not that unique to claim decentralization of the consensus algorithm. Nearly every project claims it, but few actually adhere to it (looking at Solana — validators can’t plan a network restart on a decentralized system). However, Internet Computer also claims to decentralize the servers its validator nodes utilize to perform consensus. This is in stark contrast to Ethereum, where roughly 25% of the nodes were being operated on centralized AWS infrastructure in 2019.

Internet Computer is not a direct competitor to Akash’s marketplace for underutilized computing resources. Instead, it created a system where independent node operators pay data centers to host their nodes while cloud providers get compensated for contributing computing capacity that facilitates network activity. By pairing computing resources provided by independently operated data centers around the world with its node operators, Internet Computer has attempted to make a truly decentralized protocol running on a decentralized network of data centers as opposed to AWS-owned servers. Despite similarly making use of excess computing power, Internet Computer does not generate market activity for cloud computing like Akash. It may take a share of potential cloud providers but does not seriously threaten Akash’s marketplace.

Ankr

The Ankr project launched with the intention to use idle computing resources in data centers to build an open-source cloud that it was going to call the “distributed cloud computing network.” This would have made Ankr a near replica and direct competitor to Akash. However, instead of letting users run any application on Ankr’s proposed cloud service, it pivoted to specifically providing access to Web3 infrastructure via RPCs (Remote Procedure Calls) that are used for making requests of server processes.

Exclusively focusing on Web3, node providers join the Ankr network to offer cloud services that connect those building decentralized apps, protocols, and smart contracts to various blockchains through API endpoints. Ankr uses its global node delivery system and developer toolkit to service over 50 PoS blockchains. Similar to the Internet Computer, the nodes in Ankr’s ecosystem that support its RPC layer may only threaten the number of providers Akash is able to connect to. Again, this does not seriously threaten Akash’s marketplace.

Cudos

Cudos is another item in the product line offered by the Cudo Network. With Cudo Network’s Cudo Miner product (different from Cudos), any user wishing to mine must download the Cudo Miner application, select a token to mine, and the application will mine the selected token while the machine sits idle. In the same spirit of utilizing idle compute power, Cudos will offer a very similar product to Akash with a marketplace that would connect cloud providers with underutilized resources to builders wishing to deploy WASM containers and virtual machines.

As of writing, Cudos is building its mainnet using the Cosmos SDK, while its testnet is accessible from the Big Dipper block explorer. Despite connecting idle compute power with builders, Cudos has no plans to operate its marketplace with a reverse auction or make its source code open-source like Akash. With yet to launch its mainnet, Cudos is far behind Akash in capturing market share from both the supply-side and demand-side of the cloud market.

VMs… Maybe Later

Virtual machines (VMs) are an extension of the old guard, the way virtualization solutions used to be implemented, and Akash does not have any explicit plans of supporting them. In a conversation with Akash founder Greg Osuri, he mentioned that compute providers have no restrictions on providing VM support — and that one even expressed interest — but that at this stage in Akash’s development, it wouldn’t make much sense. As a growing protocol, Akash is focused on supporting the technology with an expanding user base, not the one that enterprises use as an excuse to avoid change.

Although some industry doubts remain on containers’ ability to handle heavy-duty applications like artificial intelligence and machine learning in a similar manner to VMs, studies have proven negligible differences, if not better performance from containers. Akash recognizes the accelerating cloud compute demand for AI/ML and is preparing to handle the potential growth outside of its typical Web3 tenants.

A Compliment, not a Killer

Akash is not meant to replace the centralized cloud computing industry, it will simply complement it. If the conspirators are right, Ethereum might actually get killed by Solana, Polkadot, Cosmos, NEAR, or Algorand (not really, but a long-time Algonaut can dream). Cloud Computing and Akash’s fit in the industry is different. Similar to how Airbnb is not destroying hotels, Akash is not destroying centralized data providers. Both Airbnb and Akash simply allow individuals to rent out unused capacity.

Akash may be able to entice cloud customers by offering prices at a fraction of the cost of the big three providers, as well as providing the flexibility of no vendor lock-ins and control over the resources used to host deployments. As traditional enterprises build out crypto divisions and become more literate in Web3 technologies, Akash will be at the forefront of the decentralized cloud computing space with a functioning mainnet and a business model that alleviates supply-side inefficiencies.
