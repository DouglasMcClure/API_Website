Cleverly named after the mathematical notation, the hybrid-decentralized exchange offers perpetual futures contracts similar to the ones found on Binance, FTX, and other centralized exchanges. The protocol\u2019s ultimate goal is to build a fully decentralized derivatives exchange where no single party, including the team itself, can claim authority over the protocol\u2019s fundamental operations.\n\ndYdX was founded by Antonio Juliano, an ex-Coinbase engineer, who began working on the idea in the summer of 2017. The protocol\u2019s first two products, Expo and Solo, were built for margin trading on Ethereum. After seeing the explosion of perpetuals trading on Bitmex in 2019, dYdX decided to become the first DeFi protocol to trade perpetuals. The launch of perpetuals for major tokens like BTC and ETH quickly grew in popularity among traders seeking to use margin. Ease of use was later further improved with the addition of StarkEx layer-2 rollups in 2021. In hindsight, it is quite clear that dYdX\u2019s shift to perpetuals has paid off \u2014 the protocol has retained its status as the leading DeFi derivatives exchange.\n\nDuring Q4 2021, the dYdX community lowered market maker thresholds and increased staking rewards for the protocol\u2019s native DYDX token (stkDYDX). Additionally, the dYdX Foundation rolled out a mobile app in beta on iOS; started Trading Leagues, an open-ended trading competition; launched public trader profiles; and unveiled Hedgies, an NFT collection.\n\nMacro Overview\n\nAt the end of Q1 2022, dYdX operated 33 markets, ranging from layer-1s networks to blue-chip Ethereum DeFi tokens. Just like centralized derivatives exchanges, BTC and ETH comprise the majority of trading volume at 45.8% and 39.6%, respectively. The high trading volume of BTC and ETH, consequently, also makes it the highest source of fee revenue for the protocol.\n\nFee revenues are earned by the protocol as a percentage of each trade. Just recently, on April 19th, the protocol ended a temporary fee holiday where those fees were reduced by up to 66%. In our analysis, it\u2019s worth noting derivative exchanges operate with more capital efficiency since most trades are leveraged and fees are taken on each trade\u2019s notional size. A protocol like dYdX can stretch their revenue per dollar of collateral metric further than other DeFi business models. For example, comparing Q1 revenue-to-TVL ratios for dYdX and Uniswap shows the former calculating out to $0.14 per dollar and the latter achieving a fraction of that at $0.02 per dollar.\n\nTraders are incentivized to use the protocol through a Trader Rewards program. The mechanism distributes 3,835,616 native DYDX tokens each epoch (which lasts 28 days), to participants who have paid fees or hold positions in active contracts. A special formula is used to determine how those tokens are distributed to qualifying users. The rewards program is scheduled to last five years and is designed to boost trading volume on dYdX.\n\nWith that in perspective, dYdX facilitated $191.3 billion of trading volume in Q1 2022. The number was 23.8% lower than the total volume seen in Q4 2021. One big reason was the change of sentiment around crypto markets. In Q4, BTC and ETH both hit all-time-highs, and NFTs saw a resurgence in popularity. As a result, trading activity increased across the ecosystem, and dYdX was no exception. Interest in crypto was bound to revert back to the mean, bringing total dYdX volumes down with it.\n\nFurther trading behavior was analyzed in a recent report by Max Holloway and the team at Xenophon Labs. The team concluded that in the current rewards mechanism, traders are incentivized to maximize rewards by making trades at the end of each epoch. Making those trades towards the end provides two things: (1) traders receive their rewards shortly after making their trades, and (2) traders can better quantify the value of expected rewards.\n\nA quick glance at the chart above superficially supports that data. Every four weeks, there is the occasional week of high volume as each epoch ends. However, incentivized activity is common with DeFi protocols, and it\u2019s possible trading levels would be more evenly distributed if the rewards program was removed. Debates within governance have also taken place to determine if the rewards program should be adjusted to measure activity on a daily basis instead of by each epoch. Support was garnered from the community but no action has taken place to change the distribution of rewards.\n\nNew depositors, a proxy for new accounts, have decreased significantly since a hot Q3 2021. The metric declined 22.6% in Q1 after declining 75.3% in Q4 2021. A total of 4,894 deposits were made in Q1, bringing the total depositor count over the last year to 50,541. Although the slowdown of new accounts may seem like a challenge, the number of dYdX traders is naturally lower than spot-based DEXs because trading on leverage can be too risky for the average investor.\n\nThe weekly trader count had a positive trend throughout the quarter. Even excluding the global minimum for the first week of January (ending January 2), weekly trader counts went from 2,838 to 3,345 with a high of 4,344 traders in the second-to-last week. The most significant weekly decline occurred for the week ending March 6, which was a chaotic week for markets in general following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nOpen interest is a measure of the number of open contracts held by traders. When traders open a position, the total open interest number increases; when they close out of a contract, the open interest count decreases. The metric is commonly used as an indicator to confirm trends in markets.\n\nOpen interest edged upwards this past quarter to end at $1.3 billion. That value includes both long and short positions. Although it is difficult to glean direct information purely from open interest, The rise in open interest this past quarter could be a sign that speculators are re-entering the market after the previous quarter\u2019s slowdown.\n\nPerpetuals Market Spotlight\n\nThe first version of dYdX\u2019s perpetuals product started with three markets: Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Chainlink. Over the following two years, dYdX expanded to 33 markets supporting a variety of widely traded tokens, with an emphasis on blue-chip Layer-1s and DeFi protocols. This report focuses on the markets with the highest Q1 volume: BTC-USD, ETH-USD, and AVAX-USD.\n\nBTC-USD\n\nBTC-USD was the first market available through dYdX and is still widely traded. Total volume in Q1 was $87.6 billion, which was 20.8% lower than the previous quarter. The decline in trading volume is in line with the decline in overall trading volume for the protocol. However, in Q1, the trading volume of BTC perpetuals surpassed 2 million BTC tokens for the first time in a single quarter.\n\nAfter comparing BTC trading activity on the protocol to the same activity on several centralized exchanges (FTX, Binance, Deribit, OKX, Bybit, BitMEX, and Bitfinex), the results showed that dYdX should be considered a serious competitor in the ecosystem. The protocol facilitated $87.6 billion in trades in the BTC perpetuals market, nearly the same amount as that of established exchanges such as Deribit and BitMEX.\n\nBitcoin open interest hit an all-time high in Q3 2021 amidst a frantic bull market. Many traders opened new contracts to gain margined exposure to the price movement. The count of outstanding tokens rose from just over 1,000 to an all-time high of 8,348 on October 19, 2021. Open interest then decreased in Q4, bottoming out at 4,620 tokens before finishing this past quarter about halfway between the local maximum and minimum at 6,547.\n\nDaily bitcoin liquidations peaked on March 27 at $23.6 million. This particular day was notable as bitcoin returned to its breakeven price on the year and reached as high as $47,000 on the market. The token price increased 4.4% on the day, fueled by the $125 million purchase of BTC by the Luna Foundation Guard. Such a sudden intraday jump likely triggered a large number of liquidations by those who were holding short positions. The following day\u2019s price was also particularly high, ranking as the fourth-highest day of liquidated contracts in the quarter.\n\nETH-USD\n\nCumulative ETH trading volume for the quarter fell to $75.7 billion. The largest trading day occurred on March 14 while the lowest volume day fell on January 30. The daily range for the quarter fell between $255,000 to $2.3 billion, which is a 10x range between the high and the low. This wide range ultimately rests outside of the control of the protocol and more on larger economic events driving high-volume or low-volume trading days.\n\ndYdX held a strong market share in comparison to centralized exchanges in the ETH market. Out of the seven other exchanges, dYdX volumes came in third behind Binance and FTX, which remain the undisputed leaders of perpetuals trading. Nonetheless, adoption metrics highlight how valuable the DYDX token airdrop was to usage; dYdX activity as a percentage of centralized exchange volumes soared from a few basis points to single-digits immediately after the airdrop.\n\nETH\u2019s open interest declined throughout Q4 but is now seeing an upward trajectory heading into Q2 2022. A closer look at the metric shows open interest increasing when ETH fell to $2,500, then decreasing when ETH hit the $3,000 range. It then proceeded to rise again when ETH dipped into the mid-$2000s before flatlining as ETH settled into a range right before the end of the quarter. The overall movement of ETH open interest follows closely with BTC open interest as a strong correlation between the two assets continues to persist.\n\nThe highest daily liquidations for ETH this quarter all took place in the first few weeks of January. This came at a time when the market was reversing many of the gains earned in Q4 2021. On January 21, the ETH market saw its highest day of liquidations in the quarter. Not surprisingly, the day was brutal in the markets; the price of ETH dropped low/mid-double-digit percentages from the previous day. Notably, $13.5 billion of open contracts were liquidated after those holding the position failed to maintain the margin ratio.\n\nAVAX-USD\n\nOne reason for dYdX\u2019s relative strength in AVAX trading compared to BTC or ETH is its position as a DeFi-native exchange. The protocol facilitated $4.6B worth of AVAX trades in Q1 while centralized competitors such as Bybit, BitMEX, Bitfinex, and Deribit only achieved 10% or less of the same volume. The only exchanges which outpaced dYdX were FTX and Binance at $20.0 billion and $59.0 billion, respectively.\n\nAVAX open interest has been on the rise since August 2021 when the Avalanche network attracted attention as a popular, fast, cheap EVM-enabled network. As a result, in Q1 2022, open interest increased by 31.3%, going from 487,000 to 640,000 outstanding perpetual contracts. All of this occurred behind the backdrop of falling and then flattening AVAX token prices; the combination of falling AVAX prices but increased open interest could be read as a signal for increased investor interest in the blockchain network as a serious bet on the future.\n\nLiquidations within the quarter amounted to $21.3 million. Peak liquidations were dispersed fairly evenly throughout the three months as the token underwent higher volatility relative to ETH and BTC. AVAX began the quarter priced above $110 and fell to a low point below $70 before bouncing back. The day with the most liquidations was January 7.\n\nTrading Leagues, Profiles, and Hedgies\n\nIn an effort to continue attracting users, the dYdX announced a few new features to help gamify the trading experience. First, dYdX announced the creation of Trading Leagues in January. The leagues are a first-of-its-kind trading competition designed to boost volume by offering weekly prizes to the highest-performing traders. Prices are given out weekly (which dYdX refers to as a trading season) and vary depending on the specific league tier. Weekly cash prizes can approach $350,000. Users move between leagues according to their weekly performance. Think of the system like the one used for European soccer: the fear of relegation further incentivizes players to do well!\n\nIn conjunction with Trading Leagues, users are now able to create personal profiles. Other parties can select an individual profile and view the 30-day historical performance of that trader\u2019s portfolio.\n\nHedgies were also introduced as NFT avatars for personal profiles. A collection of 4,200 unique NFTs was distributed on Ethereum starting February 1, 2022. Hedgies did not come with a mint cost; the only price to pay was gas fees. Subsequent mints beginning February 8 were given at the end of each trading season to the most profitable traders.\n\nSource: Hedgies\n\nBeyond their status as avatars, Hedgies come with practical utility. Holders of the NFT benefit from reduced fees on the dYdX protocol. Owning Hedgies increases the trader\u2019s fee tier by one category. Since a higher fee tier (associated with a higher balance) decreases one\u2019s trading fees, acquiring a Hedgie effectively increases capital efficiency for traders.\n\nGovernance Update\n\nA few major governance proposals were active in the most recent quarter. As dYdX proceeds toward complete decentralization, governance will take on increasing importance in the management of the protocol.\n\nJanuary 7, 2022 - dYdX Grants Program\n\nReverie, a consultancy for DAOs, proposed to launch and manage a $6.25 million dYdX Grant Program (DGP). After passing the on-chain vote with unanimous support, 752,000 DYDX were moved from the Community Treasury to the Grants Multisignature Wallet (Multisig). As one of the largest community grant programs in DeFi, DGP increases the number of active contributors working on development, marketing, education, and other value accretive activities. The Grants Committee reviews all applications and controls the DGP Multisig.\n\nFebruary 1, 2022 - Liquidity Staking Pool Borrowing Requirements Framework\n\nThe Liquidity Staking Pool allows users to stake USDC for DYDX. The staked USDC is an interest-free, uncollateralized loan to pre-approved market makers, only to be used to provide liquidity to dYdX order books. While stakers do earn DYDX, they also incur counterparty risk, namely that a market maker won\u2019t be able to pay back its loan.\n\nTo help add new, reliable, and creditworthy liquidity providers to the Liquidity Provider pool, the dYdX Foundation created a set of borrowing requirements. By passing the proposal with near-unanimous support, DYDX tokenholders, who still get the final say on who borrows staked USDC, agreed to use the framework to select borrowers. Under this new framework, prospective borrowers must qualify for Liquidity Provider Rewards in the preceding epoch (by providing more than 0.25% of maker volume), and create a public profile on the dYdX community forum with all the relevant disclosures, and agree to the revolving credit agreement.\n\nFebruary 12, 2022 - Reduce the threshold for receiving liquidity provider rewards to 0.25%\n\nThe dYdX Liquidity Provider Rewards program incentivizes market liquidity by giving DYDX to certain liquidity providers. This proposal, passed with almost unanimous support, lowered the minimum maker volume threshold required to start earning these rewards from 1% to 0.25%. This change bolsters liquidity by attracting more active capital from smaller, yet still consequential, market makers.\n\nMarch 21, 2022 - Implement a Guernsey Purpose Trust for the dYdX Grants Program\n\nReverie\u2019s proposal to implement a Guernsey purpose trust for the dYdX Grant Program passed with near unanimity. As a result, the committee and Multisig will turn into a Guernsey purpose trust structure: committee members will be trustees; multisig assets will become the purpose trust, and Reverie will be the enforcer. While maintaining the same level of tokenholder control, this new structure simultaneously increases functionality and reduces risk. Some benefits include allowing the conversion of DYDX to USDC (for grants) without tax liabilities, enabling off-chain agreements, and reducing legal liabilities for all parties.\n\ndYdX Grant Program Updates\n\nSince launching DGP at the beginning of the quarter (January 10, 2022), the program has pledged more than $2 million in grants. A few notable grants are listed below:\n\nApproved:\n\nTrading Strategy Bot: Bayswater Capital, a boutique investment bank based in South Africa, will build an open-source trading bot. Any dYdX trader, regardless of location, will be able to use the bot locally through a GitHub repo.\n\nTooling Page: Chaos Labs, a protocol security platform, will build a comprehensive webpage that includes funding rates (dYdX perpetual premiums), a rewards simulator to estimate trading rewards, and a command-line interface (CLI) trading tool.\n\nIn Progress:\n\nBlockcrunch Podcast Sponsorship: Starting this month (April 2022), dYdX will become the primary sponsor of the Blockcrunch podcast for the next six months. Included in the sponsorship are brand shoutouts and commissioned guest episodes with members of the dYdX.\n\nCompleted:\n\nLiquidation Alert Tool: A self-hosted tool that alerts users in their email, Discord, Slack, or Telegram when any of their dYdX positions are close to liquidation. The bot was built by Max Holloway.\n\nDAO Organizational Structure Research: Davincifi received a grant to produce a research report examining the history of collective coordination and governance to provide actionable insights to dYdX. The complete report was published on Davincifi\u2019s Substack and can be found here. Key takeaways from the report include investing in non-technical contributors, reducing the number of decision-makers whenever possible, and encouraging more participation from those contributing on the periphery of the ecosystem.\n\nRoadmap\n\nThe biggest event on the horizon is the launch of dYdX V4. While V4 development is ongoing, the protocol also launched a new mobile app for on-the-go trading.\n\ndYdX V4\n\nAt the beginning of Q1, dYdX Trading Inc. announced its plan to fully decentralize the dYdX protocol by the end of 2022. Right now, dYdX uses the StarkEx L2 as a settlement layer, but dYdX Trading Inc. runs an off-chain order book and matching engine on centralized servers and collects all trading fees. With dYdX V4, the matching engine and order book will be fully decentralized, and dYdX Trading Inc. will not control any part of the protocol or directly collect any trading fees. While dYdX Trading Inc. will continue to develop open-source software and support the protocol\u2019s growth, aspects formerly under its purview such as market creation will be handed over to protocol governance (DYDX tokenholders).\n\nV4 might also move beyond perpetuals and support other trading products (i.e., spot, margin, synthetics, etc.), expand and improve choices around margin and collateral, build rails to support permissionless market creation, and bring improvements to trading and market structure.\n\nDue to potential constraints around throughput, finality, and fairness (frontrunning) this transition will be challenging. However, if executed, the step change in transparent, permissionless, high-performance trading and market creation will be monumental.\n\ndYdX iOS app\n\nIn early March, dYdX became one of the first DeFi protocols to launch a native mobile application, albeit in a public beta. Onboarding through the priority waitlist was contingent on holding more than 10 DYDX or one Hedgie and doing greater than $1,000 in trade volume between March 9 and March 23. Additionally, eager beta testers can still join the referral waitlist by participating in social campaigns through Reddit, Twitter, etc. Once the app does publicly launch, all dYdX users will be able to trade and monitor positions on the go like they can with centralized exchanges (e.g., FTX, Binance, etc.) today.\n\nConclusion\n\nAcross the crypto derivatives market, there are two main types of exchanges: centralized exchanges and decentralized exchanges. Centralized exchanges typically have more resources but are hampered by regulations, marred by transparency concerns, and need to be trusted by users. Meanwhile, decentralized exchanges such as dYdX have fewer resources but offer solutions to the problems centralized exchanges face.\n\nFor dYdX, the belief that decentralized services will capture more of the market share in light of their advantages is backed by the work the team is doing. With a clear roadmap towards full decentralization and competitive trading volume, the protocol remains a formidable participant leading DeFi\u2019s alternative derivatives exchanges.\n\nThis report was commissioned by the dYdX Grants Program, a member of Protocol Services.

Patterns like this resemble a consolidation phase, which indicates that the markets could be getting ready to make significant moves in the near term. Most top assets on the sectors covered traded within single-digit ranges for the week. However, most sectors had one or two outliers that broke the trend and rallied into the double-digit gains. The currencies sector came out on top this week, gaining 1.20% while gaming fell behind with -3.4%.\n\nTop Assets\n\nThe top assets by market capitalization category showed a mixed set of returns. Half of the assets yielded negative returns, while the other half ended the week on the green. However, Terra (LUNA) stood out as the only asset within the category to finish the week with a double-digit positive return. The Cosmos-based IBC chain\u2019s native asset LUNA rose in price up to 22% before shedding almost half of it, ending the week with an 11.8% gain. Dogecoin (DOGE) took last place among top assets with -4.7% for the week.\n\nDeFi Assets\n\nDeFi was another sector with mixed returns. Four of the top ten DeFi assets closed the week with single-digit losses while the rest ended in the green. Of the six assets that had positive returns, two of them clearly dominated this week. 0x Protocol stole the spotlight following the announcement that Coinbase will be leveraging the decentralized exchange infrastructure protocol to power their upcoming NFT marketplace. The 0x token\u2019s price spiked to as high as 55% on the week but has been on a continuous downtrend since reaching the weekly top. It finished the week on the top-performing asset covered with a 26.9% gain. Next up was PancakeSwap, ending the week with a 13.5% return.\n\nSmart Contract Platforms\n\nThe smart contract platform sector traded with high synchrony for the entire week with the exception of two assets \u2014 TRON (TRX) and Terra (LUNA). While the rest of the assets traded within single-digit range, the two assets broke away from the pack in the second half of the week. After over a 30% drop from its all-time-high, LUNA has managed to bounce back, securing an 11.8% return on the week. On the other hand, the unexpected rally of TRON (TRX) happened after Justin Sun announced that TRON will launch its own native algorithmic stablecoin \u2014 USDD. According to the news, it will feature a similar mechanism to UST in order to keep its peg and boast a 30% APY. The TRX token spiked 19% following the news and closed the week with an 18.5% gain.\n\nCurrencies\n\nClosely resembling how the smart contract platform sector traded, currencies also traded in close synchrony and within a single-digit channel with the exception of two outliers \u2014 privacy coins. The two outperforming currencies this week were Monero (XMR) and Zcash (ZEC). Monero (XMR) broke from the pack mid week and propelled itself to a 21.8% gain on the week. Zcash (ZEC) followed suit but to a lesser extent. It ended the week with a 10.5% return.\n\nWeb3\n\nThe Web3 sector had a more volatile week compared to the other sectors. Most tokens traded at their own trend, and returns were quite varied with four of the ten assets finishing the week with positive returns. Among those assets, Livepeer was the one to take the lead for the week. The decentralized video infrastructure protocol\u2019s token saw its price finish the week with a 7.6% return. On the other hand, Helium was the laggard of the group as it posted an 11.1% loss for the week.\n\nGaming\n\nThe gaming sector took a last second dip as some of the tokens dropped by as much as 10% in a short period of time. The dip was enough to drag most of the top assets within the sector underwater. Alice (ALICE) was the only one to finish the week on green territory by a small margin (1.4%). Yield Guild Games secured the endmost position of the group as it secured an 11.3% decline for the week.\n\n", "references": [{"name": "Guillermo Avil\u00e9s", "url": ""}], "published_at": "2022-04-22T06:31:00Z", "author": {"name": "Guillermo Avil\u00e9s"}, "tags": ["Macro"], "url": "https://messari.io/article/weekly-recap-ending-april-21"}, {"id": "f6a82fd8-cfef-490c-a3b8-224ff7136808", "title": "State of Uniswap Q1 Analyst Call Transcript", "content": "If you would like to view the full recording of the live Crowdfest event, you can find it on our YouTube channel.

I think a round of introductions would be welcome. I\u2019m sure many in the Uniswap community know who you guys are, either through discord or the grants program, but I think for anyone on the call who doesn\u2019t, I\u2019m sure that would be helpful. Happy to pass it to you guys first, and then I can go after you guys. Any of you guys want to get us started?\n\n  \nBoris Stanic (0:34): I\u2019ll go first. So when we do interviews for the grants program, one of us usually introduces all of us, since we basically all do the same thing but maybe we switch it up for this time. So, my name is Boris, I\u2019m part of the Uniswap Grants Program (UGP) and Uniswap community. For the past almost a year now, its my workaversary or DAOversary soon. What I do is review the grant applications, I host the Uniswap community calls every two weeks, and then we make sure that the grants that we support actually turn out successful \u2013 so connecting them with the right people, funding them, trying to break the barriers in front of them, basically. That\u2019s us and myself together, so yea!\n\n  \nJerry Sun (1:42): Nice to have you, Boris!\n\n  \nFederico Landini (1:46): I will go, then Yj. Hi everybody, my name is Fede and I\u2019m also part of the Uniswap Grants Program. I was a grantee, I started as a grantee, so I applied to the Uniswap Grants Program to develop a simulator to simulate Uniswap V3 strategies. I got funds and I got involved in the community, and three months ago I joined the team with Yj, Ken and Boris, and we review all together other applications and we follow up grants and help people to develop tools that help the Uniswap community.\n\n  \nYj (2:24): I\u2019m Yj and I\u2019m also one of the reviewers for the Uniswap Grants Program. I first started getting involved with Uniswap staff and helping out with more difficult user tech support on Discord. I also help kind of keep an eye on some other channels, like the international community on the Discord server, for example a Chinese channel, Japanese channel, Indonesian channel. And then about six months ago now, I started helping Boris and Ken, and later on Fede as well, with reviews on grants. Then most recently, Fede and I started the Uniswap grants Community Analytics Program, which we are running right now with data analytics bounties for various topics to encourage the open sharing of crypto and Uniswap analytics for the community, so that\u2019s me.\n\n  \nJerry Sun (3:19): Awesome, welcome everyone! My name is Jerry, I\u2019m a research analyst on the Messari team, I\u2019m based out of San Francisco here, and I wrote the Q1 quarterly report that we\u2019ll be spending some time talking about today. I also wrote the Q4 quarterly report, so I\u2019m fairly familiar with the contents of both reports, and happy to talk about some of the quarter-over-quarter changes that we saw. I think we can get started and dive into the report here. This is where I want to try to share my screen and we\u2019ll see if I\u2019m able to make this work here.\n\n  \nJerry Sun (4:41): So we got the report pulled up, this is the State of Uniswap Q1 2022. I just want to pull this up because one of the things I want to add as a quick disclaimer before we start is that traditionally in our reports, we host them on our website, messari.io, and for the quarterly reports we decided to go and covert all of them to PDF as well. We think that, just in general, PDFs are an easy way for distribution and we want to make sure that everyone in the community has an opportunity to go and read the report, to go and distribute and send to their friends for example. Ethan\u2019s got it pulled up there, and if you guys want to pull it up or check it out, it\u2019s available on the website and I think we have it linked in the chat bar to the right, at the very top. So diving into the report here, I\u2019ve actually got a presentation that I\u2019ve wanted to pull up. We can start with talking a little bit about the macro, so the key metric summary is the table that we\u2019ll want to talk about here. To give a quick overview from a high level of Uniswap and how it performed in Q1, I would say that Q1 was a very different quarter relative to Q4. There we a lot of catalysts for Q4, you think about the rise of NFTs at the beginning of Q4, bitcoin and ether hit all-time highs during that quarter, and all of that activity clearly benefits Uniswap because it encourages a lot of people to go to the DEX to make trades, it encourages trading activity. Q1, in contrast, was a little bit more of a pullback, what I would consider a reversion back to the mean, and so we did see some quarter-over-quarter decreases in total volume, in liquidity, in trading fees, things like that. One important caveat to note, though, is that this is all priced in USD equivalent denominations, so obviously even if the price of bitcoin, ether, and all these crypto tokens is decreasing, that\u2019s going to affect some of the metrics here as well. For you guys on this panel, personally, when you think about Uniswap and the health of the protocol, what are important metrics that you guys look at? What are the best ways to think about how to analyze Uniswap?\n\n  \nFederico Landini (8:33): I personally do believe to have a look at the relative performance of Uniswap compared to the other DEXs, so as you say in the last quarter Q1 that the market was quite, not as exciting let\u2019s say as it was in Q4, but if you check the dominance or the performance of Uniswap compared to other AMMs and other DEXs, Uniswap was quite consistently the top DEX also in Q1. I think that\u2019s a good sign of strength and health of the protocol.\n\n  \nBoris Stanic (9:13): Maybe I\u2019ll share my thoughts, so trading volumes and numbers don\u2019t really interest that much because it all has to do with how much crypto in general is getting traction and interest among people. As long as I see that projects are launching on top of Uniswap \u2014 for example as soon as they launch a token, there\u2019s a Uniswap pool which has a lot of activity and there are also liquidity mining incentives, and they\u2019re using Uniswap for what it was built for \u2014 that\u2019s exactly what Uniswap as a protocol needs. It\u2019s being used, and now the volumes at which it\u2019s being used just has to do with the whole cryptocurrency scene and market in general, and you can\u2019t affect it that much as a DEX or as a protocol.\n\n  \nYj (10:18): Yeah, I feel the same way in the sense that one of the things I raised when looking at the reports is that if you talk about volume reducing, we normally use the USD equivalent, so if crypto as a whole drops from one quarter to the next then you expect USD equivalent volume to just drop. So, fair dimension comparing against other DEXs and other protocols is key. The other thing to consider would be comparing against centralized exchanges because it\u2019s all part of price fighting, and Uniswap\u2019s mechanism relies on arbitrage to do the price finding, so when we compare against Coinbase and others, what does that show? Then also another very important thing for V3 especially is, of course, the capital efficiency, concentrated liquidity from the perspective of both liquidity providers in terms of earning fees and also swappers in terms of getting the best execution price, including any fee they\u2019re night need to pay on other protocols or centralized exchanges. Does Uniswap give the best value? I think those are the type of comparative metrics that I personally am most interested in.\n\n  \nJerry Sun (11:36): Right, I think those great points that you make and Yj just to supplement what you\u2019re saying, there\u2019s not a lot Uniswap can do as an individual protocol relative to the broader crypto economy, your metrics are just going to fluctuate just depending on how crypto does in general for the quarter. Just to back that up with some numbers, and Yj pointed this out earlier, that crypto as an entire ecosystem went from $3T in Q4 to $2T at the end of Q1. So that is almost a 50% decrease in terms of how the size of the economy shrank, but when you look at some of these metrics, I think Uniswap actually showed its resiliency because volume only decreased 20%. So what does that mean? It means that if you convert the USD equivalent, Uniswap probably did just as well or maybe even slightly better in Q1 than it did in the previous quarter. There\u2019s probably a continued growth of users, of trades, and I think those are all positive signs. I don\u2019t know if you guys all saw this, but on Twitter, Coinbase announced a bunch of new tokens that they want to list and it\u2019s a lot of stuff that people don\u2019t necessarily know. Some of them people do and a decent number of them people did not know, and that\u2019s something I\u2019ve been thinking about because it seems like they\u2019re trying to compete with Uniswap because it\u2019s so easy to go and list a token on Uniswap. Once you have an airdrop or whatever it\u2019s immediately on there, whereas with Coinbase it\u2019s just so much harder to do that, but they\u2019re trying to list as many tokens as they can. That\u2019s gonna be an advantage that Uniswap will probably have over centralized exchanges. I think you guys made great points and the way you guys think about Uniswap is something I definitely agree with, a very holistic picture.\n\nWe can jump now to the next slide, and I want to talk about the growth of Polygon. This is a graph we\u2019ve included in the report, but on the left side of this chart here, you got to see some of the scaling solutions start to take place in terms of liquidity. It\u2019s still very dominated by Ethereum, which is the dark and light blue shading, which represents V2 and V3, but one of the biggest winners of Q1 was Polygon. Their growth was very organic, there weren\u2019t any liquidity mining incentives that went live in Q1, they I believe are live now for the first week of April. When Polygon says they\u2019re going to institute liquidity mining, my question for you guys is does Uniswap or do people in the community have any sort of interaction with the Polygon team? How do people hold them to it to make sure that gets implemented?\n\n  \nBoris Stanic (15:42): Maybe I\u2019ll answer this one since I was the most involved. I tweeted out a small thread about 100 days after the proposal passed and there wasn\u2019t too much news about the liquidity mining incentives, but I wasn\u2019t paying enough attention so that\u2019s a mistake on my part. There was actually a developer from Polygon who was updating people but I didn\u2019t follow him so I didn\u2019t see this. Polygon main accounts are just too busy always updating us on the things that are actually launching, so they don\u2019t update people on things they\u2019re working on because they\u2019re constantly launching something. To your question, we do not have a say in how liquidity mining incentives will look on Polygon, it\u2019s completely organized by the Polygon team. As to how we will hold them accountable to make sure these promises are fulfilled, the Polygon team is a highly respectful one and even though it\u2019s not common in crypto, we trusted that they will. There wasn\u2019t a trustless process, so they said there would be up to $15M in liquidity mining incentives and we said, \u201cYea sure! That sounds good.\u201d If some time passed and if they didn\u2019t do anything, we wouldn\u2019t be able to do anything as well, but I know the other internet research group that\u2019s being supported by the Uniswap Grants Program is actually researching how we can make this trustless. If someone claims that they will do something if a proposal passes, what kind of mechanics can we implement so this becomes a trustless process and it gets executed automatically? Hopefully I didn\u2019t miss any of your questions.\n\n  \nJerry Sun (18:06): No, I think that\u2019s great. In the governance proposal for Polygon, and the way you phrased it as well, you know it\u2019s phrased as \u201cwe\u2019re going to give up to $15M of liquidity mining incentives and up to $5M to support the ecosystem around V3 on Polygon.\u201d I saw recently through the live liquidity mining that right now they've set aside $3M through a third-party, and what I\u2019m curious about is if that\u2019s what traditionally occurs when they say we\u2019re gonna give \u201cup to 15\u201d but then they set aside $3M? Also, is it common to use a third-party, I think they used Iracus Finance, to go and set that up? Are those things you traditionally see?\n\n  \nBoris Stanic (19:07): I think this was the first time in history, at least of Uniswap, that somebody promised something and then liquidity mining incentives happened. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a usual case for it or am I missing something? Do you have any other examples of this kind of deal happening?\n\n  \nFederico Landini (19:41): I don\u2019t think it\u2019s happened in the Uniswap ecosystem, and as Boris was saying, it\u2019s probably an area of improvement where governance has to figure out how to make sure these agreements are followed up on. I think it\u2019s an area that\u2019s interesting, but in this case it was the first time so maybe it was not perfect but in the end it came through.\n\n  \nJerry Sun (20:23): Right, and to summarize here, Polygon has had organic growth even without the liquidity mining. They\u2019ve been the fastest rising in terms of growth relative to time out of the non-Ethereum scaling solutions for V3, so they\u2019ve done a tremendous job.\n\n  \nFederico Landrini (20:47): As we said at the beginning, we are running a Uniswap analytics program, and one of the bounties that we published was exactly about the growth of Uniswap on Polygon. We got some really great dashboards from the community that show how fast Uniswap was able to affirm itself on Polygon, and in less than a month it became the biggest DEX on Polygon without liquidity mining incentives. I think this is a very interesting data point that our analyst in the community pointed out.\n\n  \nJerry Sun (21:27): Right, and the Polygon community is just, in general, very big too, so I think there\u2019s a lot of market capture opportunity for Uniswap.\n\n  \nYj (21:39): Yeah, that\u2019s what I was going to say. I think part of this is dependent on how much ERC-20s have already been bridged over from Mainnet to Polygon prior to the Uniswap V3 launch, following the successful governance proposal. The different scaling solutions all went online onto Mainnet at different times, and then on each of them, they are different major and maybe chain-exclusive projects that launch on them. Some of them, like Polygon, I haven\u2019t really looked into the data yet and maybe this is one analysis that would be interesting to look at, but they might have already had a lot of projects and tokens being bridged over or launched natively or exclusively for Polygon. So when Uniswap is there, there\u2019s a lot more tokens available for liquidity and swapping. That\u2019s maybe a gut feeling on my end, since I haven\u2019t looked at the data. Then in terms of the liquidity mining promise, it\u2019s going to be very difficult as a community and grants program to encourage more trustless tooling and processes to make everything smoother and better. But if you think about it, when the Polygon governance proposal was put out, there was never any cross-chain governance process or tooling at all, so it had to be a trust-based thing. When they, \u201cwe will launch on Polygon,\u201d at the time, Uniswap Labs had to work with them to launch it and put in the rails to make sure everything works. Since then, things have been happening and UGP actually funded GFX Labs to start researching cross-chain governance for Uniswap, and that resulted in a successful test case activation of one of the basis point pools on Polygon, just a few days ago. Hoping that as a grants program, we can encourage more and more of this type of research and tooling development to make things move towards full trustlessness.\n\n  \nBoris Stanic (24:05): Can I just share one thing when it comes to L2 solutions that I think might be important?\n\n  \nJerry Sun (24:13): Yeah, absolutely.\n\n  \nBoris Stanic (24:15): So we have a graph here of liquidity and I don't think that liquidity and volume, in terms of numbers, is as important as a number of unique addresses that interacted on the certain L2 solution. Big whales and big traders will always prefer the security of a main chain and liquidity of a main chain over trusting some L2 solution because the safest chain is the Ethereum chain. But what happens on the main chain is that smaller traders get priced out by gas and here is where L2 solutions come into play and they make it so that you can still do trustless swaps in a fully decentralized way, well not fully but as far as it currently goes. It just opens the door for smaller traders to enter the scene and invest in the tokens and swap tokens that they like, so that's what's one point that I want to share.\n\n  \nJerry Sun (25:32): Right, I think that's a great point. I guess Boris, to add on to what you're saying, one reason why, in my opinion, Polygon has really taken off is that it\u2019s just seen as a side chain. It's very easy to bridge between Polygon and Ethereum, but you go to something like Optimism, optimistic L2 rollups, and it's a little bit more difficult to move money back and forth, in terms of waiting periods and things like that. So I assume that when zk-rollups become live or you can launch smart contracts on zk-rollups, the governance community at Uniswap are probably gonna go and try to set that up as well, and we'll probably see some good organic growth from there too because again, like you said, there\u2019s cheaper costs but you don't have to worry about some of the the difficulties with using the optimistic rollups in that sense.\n\n  \nBoris Stanic (26:34): Yeah, definitely. The L2 scene is still developing and people put a lot of hope into zk-rollups to make it even better, but we'll have to wait and see. Ethereum as a chain is also progressing and will be able to sustain more transactions per second and the combination of these two things might make it so that we don't ever see $300 fees on Uniswap ever again. It will be something that we will tell kids about, you know, so the whole scene is just making it so that it can sustain higher throughput in a sustainable way, so not jeopardizing decentralization and security too much. That will enable lower fees, which will enable more people to actually use Uniswap as a dapp on those chains.\n\n  \nJerry Sun (27:52): Right, right. Yj you mentioned something that I thought was pretty interesting, which is the cross-chain governance proposal that's going on right now with Polygon. I talk about it in the report, but extremely successful, and I think a very good example of governance coming together and coming up with something that is really beneficial to everyone; to LPs, to people who want to make swaps on Uniswap. I think since its creation it\u2019s generated like $2.5M to $3M of fees for LPs, so that\u2019s a big win for everyone. I guess I'm kind of curious to hear your thought on this, because in terms of cross-chain governance, this is the first example of cross-chain governance, but in the future how do you envision cross-chain governance to play out? Do you think, \u201cright now it's live on Ethereum and then gets implemented on Polygon,\u201d do you think that will continue to be the case? Do you guys think it might be the other way around, where maybe you test something on Polygon if there's a little less activity you see if it works, and then you try it on Ethereum? Assuming cross-chain governance works, what are your takes on that?\n\n  \nYj (29:15): I think it's hard to say. It's still developing, it's so new. And just in governance in general, even voting mechanisms, are being changed all the time by different projects and people are still experimenting on it. The thing with Uniswap governance and the Uniswap protocol as a whole is the immutable nature of it. So as it stands now, that has been deployed without further governance proposals that get passed and executed. There is no simple way of doing more complex cross-chain stuff, so the Polygon one has to necessarily go from Mainnet onto Polygon because the $UNI token where voting power lies is on Mainnet Unisawap, right. And actually, in the previous community call that Boris hosted, we also quickly discussed this in terms of governance, the fact that $UNI token actually loses its voting power if it's bridged to other side chains or L2s, if you put it in LP, if you put it on lending protocol. We actually have a current live data bounty program asking the community to contribute to this, and to look into the extent of loss of $UNI voting power when you utilize it for other things. But going back to your original question, you were saying whether I personally see experimentation being done on L2s or chains before moving back, I mean as it stands that cannot happen, but that's not to say that it will not happen. I'm personally quite excited to see what people come up with to experiment on this, and actually Uniswap Grants Program is looking for people to submit applications to research and maybe prototype or test or experiment with all these. I think it will be pretty exciting to see, and of course with Uniswap continuing to get deployed on other chains, stuff like cross-chain processing mechanism will become more and more important, so I'm personally quite looking forward to seeing the new stuff that can come up from there.\n\n  \nJerry Sun (31:31): Right, definitely. Well, you know, you bring up the grants program, and you guys are exploring a lot of different ways to do some studies on how you can do governance with the $UNI token on other chains, and just other initiatives in general for the grants program. I want to talk about the grants program a little bit here, this is obviously your bread and butter, seeing all these proposals. The first question I have is a fun one for myself which is, when I go and DM the Uniswap Grants Program Twitter handle, which one of you guys is responding to me?\n\n  \nBoris Stanic (32:15): None of us, I think. We have a shadow writer.\n\n  \nJerry Sun (32:24): Well whoever that person is, I just wanted to say how very friendly and very helpful, so thank you. Thank that person, whoever it is.\n\n  \nBoris Stanic (32:35): I mean, I think you can deduce who it is. It\u2019s nobody in this chat.\n\n  \nJerry Sun (32:41): Right, of course. Well tell us a little about the grants program, how are decisions made in the grants program? In terms of deciding what projects or proposals get funded, is it a group decision? Do you guys each look at proposals individually? What is the structure of that?\n\n  \nYj (33:11): Boris you undertake this one?\n\n  \nBoris Stanic (33:14): Okay I'll do it since I think I\u2019ve spent the longest period of time as part of the grants program. Essentially, it is a group decision and a key question that we always ask ourselves when we look at the applications is: does this fall into the grand program scope? So the program was established by the governance to fund public goods and promote the protocol in the ecosystem, but promoting doesn't really mean marketing, at least that's what we believe. So when you look at the public goods, one key question that we ask ourselves and look for in the application is: will this happen if we don't intervene? So let's say somebody is making a for-profit project, and then a small part of that for-profit project touches Uniswap, and they would like us to fund development of the project for that part which touches Uniswap. The answer to the question, \u201cwill it happen if we don't fund it?\u201d is yes because they're building a whole project also and this key part will also be part of it. But on the other side, we have different SDKs, libraries, and things that wouldn't really exist or, even better, wouldn't exist in a humane way, because somebody would spend hours and hours developing it and making it great for the others to use and wouldn't get any kind of compensation for it. That\u2019s when we step in with our connections, so grantees have questions and we make sure that they get answers, and we also support them financially so that they don't work on these things for free. We have a small process, we do weekly sprints where we have two ongoing sprints at the same time, so we do interviews and then we do you know discussions and internal reviews. These are two separate sprints where, if the previous week was interviews, the current week is discussions, and we try to find more information if we need it. Then for the interviews, we just do the interviews and take notes so we can discuss it and do more research the next week. I think since Fede and Yj joined we\u2019ve had the just right amount of reviewers and people to not have an expanding backlog like we had before, so I think we're pretty up to date right now. But it's always a discussion and our working group trusts each other, so maybe if I personally don't see value in some proposal but Fede or Yj think that it's really good for the ecosystem, I will trust their call. Of course we are not perfect, we make mistakes and we try to correct those as well through some of the other grants that we do, such as Gitcoin, where we actually let the community decide how funds will be distributed. Hopefully that\u00a0 answers your question.\n\n  \nJerry Sun (37:45): Right, definitely. This is not the most direct comparison, I know there's some differences, but I think the grants program almost like you guys are investors and you're making investments not for for-profit businesses per se, and you're not looking for a direct financial return, but rather to grow the ecosystem to benefit the Uniswap protocol and the crypto community as a whole. So when investors give money to a project, typically they also get updates maybe once a month or once a quarter, as they want to know how their investment is doing, what have you guys done with this funding, and things like that. I know there's not always follow-ups in terms of governance, but with the grants program, if I want to come to you with a project for $25,000 and then you guys approve it, what goes after the approval process? Do you have check-ins with the proposer?\n\n  \nBoris Stanic (38:57): Somebody else should answer this, but yes, so maybe Yj they or Fede since you know the process.\n\n  \nFederico Landrini (39:03): Yes, we have continuous checks, monthly or bi-monthly depending on the project, to check the the status and to try to help the grantee as much as possible with our connection to the Uniswap Labs team or to other resources from other projects. As I shared at the beginning, I was a grantee myself so I went through this process and this is what made me more and more involved in the community, and at the end, ended up part of the grants program team itself. It's also an opportunity for the grantees to be involved more, to participate in hackathons, in presentations, really it's not only that they need to work on their project but it's being part of the community and helping each other to be successful in the end.\n\n  \nYj (39:53): Yeah, I think the distinction between VC investors and the grants program is an important one, in the sense that when we accept a grant application, we will ask for a sensible timeline and what the plan is. Then we put in sensible milestones for those check-ins and they don't have to be super straight in terms of deadlines or timing, but if we don't hear something back from a grantee, the main worry is that they are facing blockers that they cannot surpass. We are here to encourage people to work together in open-source ways and create public goods for the Uniswap ecosystem. So the worry is not so much about people running away with $5,000 or something, it's more about if there is something blocking you from achieving the aims of the grant that you applied for. So the check-in plays a role in that sense, to see how we can help, because as Fede said, they might need some input from the Labs team, they might need input from from other people within crypto, so we try to make those connections for them in order to maximize the return from grants. And, you know, Uniswap Grants Program was given a mandate to do so by community governance, so that's a bit of a difference.\n\n  \nJerry Sun (41:26): Right, that makes sense. From you all\u2019s perspective, what are some of the biggest challenges that you guys face when you go through proposals, when you accept proposals, and just managing the grants program? I've heard from people who are part of grants programs, and they always say it\u2019s a very time consuming job, it's a very extensive role. And you know, Fede, from what you're saying it sounds like you guys have check-ins, and if you guys have check-ins with I don't know how many grants you guys approve every week, I assume it's you know one or two or several maybe a week, that's a decent number of check-ins that you kind of continuously have to do every month or every two months. I'm just kind of curious, from your perspective, what are some of the blockers on your end if you guys have any?\n\n  \nFederico Landrini (42:28): Personally, I think the broadness of the space and the knowledge that you have to have to to judge some of the projects is the most difficult part for us, because as you know, crypto is a very very technical space, and we move from development to tokeneconomics to governance to analytics, so there is a very broad surface that we try to cover as much as possible, and when we cannot do it, we try to to get help in the community to get the knowledge that is required to understand the proposal.\n\n  \nJerry Sun (43:22): Gotcha. Do you guys have any sort of funding minimum or maximum for any of the proposals? I know that these are kind of arbitrary, these waves, they don't really correlate to any specific period of time, you just kind of batch them together. However, wave six is noticeably higher in terms of the funding than in previous waves, and a big part of that is due to the other internet funding. I think that was very significant, but just in terms of how much you're able to give, are there any sort of restrictions on your end?\n\n  \nBoris Stanic (44:07): There are no restrictions really, well other internet grant was really big, but it's actually delegated funding, so they will use those funds to fund more grants and research and different people, so it's not just a team where five or six of them get the whole million dollars. It will actually be sort of like a subDAO or committee, but they do great things in the research, so that's why we decided to support them. When we talk about minimums and maximums, there are no such things, but you\u2019re right, wave eight already exists but it wasn't announced so it's just an arbitrary amount of applications that we you know cut and then you say, \u201cokay this is a wave.\u201d Also some things that you'll probably see in the wave eight that we started doing recently are smaller grants, and we're open to having a smaller part especially when it comes to different events in different parts of the world and different communities. So for spoilers, in the wave eight you will see a lot of smaller grants that are targeting different events and communities across the world, and we think that that's a great way of just spreading the word of Uniswap and also helping these communities grow because, let's say $5,000 to some community event that is not in the most expensive part of the world will encourage more people than you would otherwise get. You will have a greater impact than spending $20,000 or $30,000 on a San Francisco event, so we are more open to sponsoring these smaller grants recently. Maybe something to add Yj?\n\n  \nYj (46:41): Yeah, I was going to say that in terms of the amounts, at the end of the day, the grants program is somewhat a reactive process, so we do not prescribe or dictate how grant applications should be. It\u2019s somewhat reactive and organic in the sense that it might just happen that during wave six, for whatever reason, a lot of people happen to prepare their grants application and submit their model at the same time, and then the ones that were deemed fundable just all added up right. Then, what Boris was saying about the spoiler alert for wave eight, we don't know why, but wave eight actually had quite a few more event sponsorship-type grant applications that came in of different sizes, and we made the decision to fund them because we see value in them. So that's why some funds, some waves, given that arbitrary like drawing of timing, can be big or small or can be anything really. But one one thing to note would be that we avoid funding things that are just purely an idea with no work done yet, like if someone comes in and say, \u201cI have this grand idea but I haven't done anything about it, I need money to do it,\u201d we try to avoid doing that normally. Our thinking, and I think we're in alignment, is that grants funding should be mostly for things that people already put some thought and effort into, already pursued, and have some minimal progress to show. So that also influences our decision-making process.\n\n  \nJerry Sun (48:24): Right, you guys want to see a minimum viable product, I guess.\n\n  \nBoris Stanic (48:30): It\u2019s not really that we demand, it's just the necessity because we are a small grant program in terms of people who are part of it, and we don't have enough manpower to get the whole project off the ground because that's the hardest part, getting it off the ground. We are here more to help you get from the current stage of your project to the next stage of your project, but getting the whole thing off the ground is currently too much for us. Maybe sometime in the future if we grow in numbers and manpower, we will be able to support such ideas, but right now it's more about getting the projects to the next level.\n\n  \nJerry Sun (49:24): Right, right. Some of the things that you said in your earlier answer, Boris, about funding events in some smaller places, I think that's a really great idea. You're really stretching the value of the funding in a lot of ways, and I assume some will be similar to Art Basel and we have it on the screen here as one of the things that you guys funded previously or funded last year but, uh I think that funding went to setting up a booth right to onboard people into crypto. Is that a similar goal that you guys are hoping to achieve with these funds for the smaller events?\n\n  \nBoris Stanic (50:10): For the smaller events, when we think about it, it's not as much about Uniswap as it is about onboarding people to the cryptocurrency space and blockchain space in general. So we want to support people getting into the community of blockchain in general, and then eventually they will stumble upon Uniswap almost for sure, which is great for us. So yeah, we want to support these communities to grow and eventually they will reach Uniswap as well. And yeah, a similar case with Art Basel, we thought that there will be a lot of people there that have interest in cryptocurrencies, but maybe didn't have anybody you know to onboard them to the space, so we thought it'd be a great idea for us as a grant program to support that.\n\n  \nJerry Sun (51:26): Right, gotcha. That makes a ton of sense. I'm really excited to kind of see the grants that get released in wave eight. You gave a little spoiler here, but curious to see what things got funded. If we move to the governance section, I know we got a couple minutes here at the very end, and I know there are some questions that we'll get to from the community, but if we go to the next page in this deck, the last page in this deck, I\u2019ve got a list of some major governance updates from this past quarter. It's a little bit small here, but one of the things I really want to talk about and get your personal opinions on is the fee switch. This fee switch is something that everyone talks about, it's very famous in the crypto community, and I think for this particular proposal, it got rejected because it sounds like people wanted to go and set up a research group to understand how to best set up the fee switch or how to best turn on the fee switch. In your personal opinions, when do you think the fee switch should be turned on, if ever, and how should it be done if that time does come?\n\n  \nBoris Stanic (52:55): Yj maybe you take this one, I know you have a lot of opinions about the research.\n\n  \nYj (53:02): Sorry I was just typing answers in the chat. I think the fact that no consensus has been forthcoming kind of just says it all. We have people asking about and proposing it and and talking about it, but it never really got enough traction as far as I can see, so in terms of the incentive, if you have fee switch then the community treasury will get the fee, so it gets fed back to the community treasury which is also controlled by $UNI token holders with delegated voting rights. So if overall, the dedicated voting power collectively feels that fee switching is a good thing, then I would imagine you go ahead and at least progress a bit further. My personal opinion right now is that nothing is happening yet, maybe there's no real need for it yet, but it can happen anytime, so we should continue conversations and have debates about this. If possible, we should get some data-backed opinions or commentary on it to see what to do next, so that's what I think.\n\n  \nJerry Sun (54:45): But do you think the fee switch will ever happen? Because, in theory, there is a potential future where you have this fee switch and it just never gets turned on, because the way the current system is, LPs get a lot of fees and it works for them and then Uniswap as a protocol provides a service, they don't necessarily earn protocol revenue that goes to the community. I don't know if you guys think it will ever happen or not?\n\n  \nFederico Landrini (55:19): It\u2019s a good question and I don't think there is an answer. It's very difficult to forecast what will happen. For me personally, the important part is the health of the protocol and the growth of the protocol, and then I think that when the community is ready and we know what we want to do, we can find a solution. The important thing is to have a LP protocol, and then once we decide to switch or another governance decision that improves the tokeneconomics of you of the $UNI token, it could work. So for me, the key thing at the moment is to really focus on the health of the protocol, as you showed your report.\n\n  \nJerry Sun (56:04): Right, right. I think that makes a lot of sense. We have a couple of questions from the community here, so I think we could spend the last couple of minutes answering those. The first question I notice is, \u201cplease tell us quarterly volume of centralized exchanges like Binance and Coinbase, so we can compare how they are doing with Uniswap.\u201d To my knowledge, I think Coinbase processed about $525B worth of trades in the quarter and I think the previous quarter was around like $330B or so. For them, it was an increase, but compared to Uniswap, if you look at the quarters, I think Uniswap processed about $180B. So the values you're looking at are $180B and $525B. Uniswap is processing about a third of the transaction volume of Coinbase, but Coinbase is seen as a traditional fiat on-ramp for a lot of people. Institutions are also heavily active on a lot of centralized exchanges, so it's not a direct apples-to-apples kind of comparison in that sense, but I think to say that Uniswap is processing a third of the transaction volume of a company like Coinbase is no small feat, in my personal opinion. Another question I\u2019ve got is, \u201cthe purpose of Uniswap grants is to encourage development of projects built on top of\u00a0 the Uniswap protocol or something else?\u201d\n\n  \nBoris Stanic (58:00): It\u2019s to grow the Uniswap protocol and its ecosystem, so we encourage development on top of Uniswap. We believe if we make it streamlined, easier, better documentation, more resources supporting more programming languages and make that whole process more enjoyable, that is how we encourage development on top of Uniswap. Finding strategic partnerships and things like that is out of scope for the grants program, so we are here so that once you decide to build on top of Uniswap, you have the best time of your life. But making you and giving you a reason to do so, that's more for that particular team or a person to decide on.\n\n  \nJerry Sun (59:02): Right, got it. This last question we have from the community is: these governance proposals seem fixated on extending Uniswap to other fledging protocols. This is worrisome. Who is focusing on making the core product better and easier to use? This comes from John. I can answer this one as well. We're talking about the uniswap grants program, and that's separate from Uniswap Labs. Uniswap Labs is doing a lot of the development of the protocol they've got the engineers who are working on the protocol. The grants program is a portion of the funding from the treasury and their mandate is to essentially, like Boris was saying, build the Uniswap ecosystem and spread awareness on the crypto economy as a whole, so completely separate. I'm sure the people at Uniswap are definitely working on improving the product, and I think we are at time here so we can just about wrap up. John's question is actually very related to my final question which is: you guys are a little bit closer to what's going on with Uniswap than many of us on the call, so I wanted to just quickly ask if you have any alpha or any insights into what Uniswap V4 might look like. I think we're all kind of curious.\n\n  \nYj (1:00:35): I don't have anything. I actually don't. I have no idea and that's why we were saying the other day, remember that the grants program is completely separate from Uniswap Labs, so I don't know, maybe Boris has some alpha.\n\n  \nBoris Stanic (1:00:53): To be honest, the first time I heard about V4 was yesterday when they were discussing some applications and somebody said, \u201cthis will help in researching the V4,\u201d and so that's as much as I know about the V4. Did somebody say there will be a V4?\n\n  \nJerry Sun (1:01:17): I assume there will be, that's kind of my assumption.\n\n  \nBoris Stanic (1:01:21): Okay, this is just my personal opinion of what Uniswap V4 might be. So Uniswap V4, in my opinion, will be a Uniswap that combines all the different deployments. You'll have a single interface, you'll select which token you want to swap to which token, and it will execute on some chain where you will get optimal fees, slippage, price and execution time. You won't even know where it executed, but the tokens that you wanted will end up in your wallet and that will actually be the V4. We, as a governance, deploying Uniswap V3 on all these different chains, scaling solutions side chains whatever, is the path to V4, but as I said, this is just my opinion of what V4 might be.\n\n  \nJerry Sun (1:02:29): All right. Fede, Yj, do you guys want to make any predictions?\n\n  \nFederico Landrini (1:02:33): No, no predictions. I like the vision of Boris, but it's just a wish at the moment. We really don't have any kind of insight on a roadmap or anything like that.\n\n  \nJerry Sun (1:02:47): Got it. Alrighty, well we are kind of past the hour here. I appreciate you guys all hopping on, this is a really enjoyable experience and I enjoyed getting to chat about the health of the protocol, what you guys are doing on the grants program, and some of these roadmap and governance updates that are currently ongoing. Thanks everyone for tuning in, the audience and to the three of you guys, and wish you guys a good rest of the day.", "references": [{"name": "Jerry Sun", "url": ""}], "published_at": "2022-04-18T00:01:00Z", "author": {"name": "Jerry Sun"}, "tags": ["Quarterly-Reports"], "url": "https://messari.io/article/state-of-uniswap-q1-analyst-call-transcript"}, {"id": "8c697fcf-4ec8-433c-a427-cdcfd6355a03", "title": "Weekly Recap Ending April 14", "content": "Notable Messari Intel Updates\n\nCircle Internet Financial, the issuer of USDC, announced that it has agreed to <a href=\"https://messari.io/intel/event/d563a1c1-091d-4ab8-b635-c09d90cc7108\">raise $400 million</a> from BlackRock, Fidelity Management and Research, Marshall Wace LLP, and Fin Capital in a funding round expected to close in Q2 2022.

The teams will also work together to establish deep liquidity pools for aUSD and UST on Acala to serve as a gateway into the Polkadot ecosystem for UST users.\nUniswap has announced the <a href=\"https://messari.io/intel/event/64e86352-7962-43e8-a53a-cc4a4f1c2624\">launch of Uniswap Labs Ventures</a>. The announcement said that \u201cUniswap Labs Ventures will invest in teams at different stages and levels of the Web3 stack, from infrastructure to developer tools and consumer-facing applications.\u201d\nThe Yearn Finance Team, via Twitter, <a href=\"https://messari.io/intel/event/033c55a4-5b5d-4c24-b917-9345b008b771\">endorsed the adoption of the ERC-4626 token type</a>, a new standard for tokenized Vaults and yield-bearing tokens. The team stated, \"In a word, ERC-4626 will be the gold standard for any sort of interest-bearing token\u2026 from Yearn Vaults to AAVE deposits and Balancer linear pools.\" Currently, contributors are working to implement the ERC - 4626 standard for Yearn V3 Vaults with no stated timeline for completion.  \n\nNotable Messari Governor Updates\n\nBitDAO has <a href=\"https://messari.io/governor/proposal/bbbd0865-5cd5-4cf6-a20a-a8cca766d92e\">submitted a proposal</a> that aims to approve a partnership between BitDAO and PleasrDAO in which BitDAO will invest $6.5 million (95% ETH/USDT and 5% in BIT). PleasrDAO is a collector DAO that buys and funds culturally significant digital art pieces. The partnership will diversify BitDAO's investment into art/NFTs. Voting is currently active.\nAfter the Balancer team discovered that the current gauge system does not perform as intended in the original veBAL tokenomics proposal, the Balancer DAO <a href=\"https://messari.io/governor/proposal/acadec86-d86f-436e-97ff-46dcff998e3f\">submitted a proposal</a> that aims to determine whether the Balancer community prefers to deploy a new veBAL gauge system or use the current gauge system.

The Beta release will run for 28 days concurrently with a $30 million BNT rewards program (13,043,478 BNT) and a $1 million bug bounty supported by the Bancor Foundation.\nThe DODO DAO <a href=\"https://messari.io/governor/proposal/2ced1bfa-4f12-4168-822d-7e6af3245e3f\">failed</a> to pass a proposal aimed to solve the issues of multichain voting rights and low voter turnout for the DODO governance. To solve the multichain voting rights, it seeked to approve creating a new governance framework for use in place of Snapshot. The new voting system would be similar to Snapshot, using an off-chain signature collection and a decentralized storage system to count votes. However, it would account for DODO held in multiple chains when assigning voting power to users, unlike the current strategy that only accounts for DODO on Ethereum.\n\nSector Returns\n\nThe crypto market has tumbled again, marking the second week in a row where all sectors covered return drawdowns. Four of the six sectors covered returned double digit-losses, with Web3 being the biggest loser. The Web3 sector has been among the hardest hit during the recent weeks \u2014 this week losing 12.57%. Gaming also had a rough week, trading places with Web3 as the sector with the biggest decline most recently. It returned -11.41% on the week.\n\nTop Assets\n\nDogecoin (DOGE) has continued to hold its ground. It was the only asset within the top 10 assets by market capitalization that made it above water last week, and this week, it declined the least. This week, the original dog coin only lost 1.4% in value. Contrast this to Terra (LUNA) which was the laggard of the group and ended the week with a 21.4% decline.\n\nDeFi Assets\n\nAll top DeFi assets by market capitalization ended the week in the red with the exception of one \u2014 Loopring (LRC). The zkRollup-based Layer-2 platform\u2019s asset saw its price gain 5.8% on the week, while the broader DeFi ecosystem suffered losses. Aside from the one outlier, more than half of the DeFi assets saw double-digit losses. Anchor (ANC), after being the top-performing DeFi asset for last week, gave all of its gains back and now finds itself more than 65% down from all-time-high. The Terra-based lending and borrowing platform saw its token end the week with a 13.5% loss. Impressively, although most DeFi assets are far away from all-time-high territory, DeFi TVL has remained on relatively healthy levels, currently sitting at $159.39 billion.\n\nSmart Contract Platforms\n\nAll top smart contract platform tokens ended the week in negative territory, with 7 of the top 10 assets by market capitalization seeing double-digit negative returns. NEAR protocol started the week on a high note, gaining 12% in value but then giving it all back and joining the rest of the sector performance wise. The Proof-of-Stake-based blockchain token managed to secure the number one spot for the week by a small margin, having the smallest decline (-5.3%). Terra (LUNA) was the laggard of the group, ending the week with a 21.9% decline.\n\nCurrencies\n\nOnly two currencies ended the week in green territory, with Monero (XMR) leading the pack and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) taking the second spot. XMR traded above positive territory for most of the week, which was enough to help the privacy-focused coin secure the first spot with a moderate 2.2% gain. Bitcoin Cash on the other hand slumped mid-week with the rest of the sector but was able to recover the 10% loss in order to secure its second place with a 0.7% gain. Zcash had the largest decline within the top currencies by market capitalization, ending the week with a -17.1% return.\n\nWeb3\n\nThe worst performing sector of the week saw six of its top ten assets end the week with losses in the double-digits. Interestingly the biggest losers were among the highest by market capitalization within the sector. The asset that declined the least within the category was Audius (AUDIO), returning -5.9% on the week. Filecoin (FIL) secured the endmost position of the group with a 15.8% decline.\n\nGaming\n\nGaming was the second worst performing sector of the week, with losses ranging from -4.5% to -15.5% and half of the top assets returning double-digit losses. Aavegotchi (GHST) is one of the less volatile assets within the gaming ecosystem and sustained the least drawdown for the week with a 4.5% decline. Yield Guild Games (YGG) held the rear position this week with a 15.5% loss.\n\n", "references": [{"name": "Guillermo Avil\u00e9s", "url": ""}], "published_at": "2022-04-15T14:08:00Z", "author": {"name": "Guillermo Avil\u00e9s"}, "tags": ["Macro"], "url": "https://messari.io/article/weekly-recap-ending-april-14"}, {"id": "9e3bab38-f604-4e39-ad30-a6f0d8c711b7", "title": "State of Compound Q1 2022", "content": "Download a PDF version of this report by clicking here.pdf).\n\nInteract with the real-time data that created this report on the Dune Analytics dashboard.\n\nKey Insights\n\nOutstanding Loans and Deposits fell 42% and 32%, respectively.\nLiquidation metrics increased 290%, exceeding $134 million in Q1.\nCOMP incentives have dropped 50% in the quarter and are set to diminish to zero by Q2.\nQuarterly borrow and deposit rates averaged 3.8% and 1.5%, respectively\nDAI quarterly deposits declined over 90% in the Q1\n\nIntroduction to Compound\n\nLaunched in September 2018, Compound is a leading interest rate protocol built on Ethereum that enables users to permissionlessly borrow and lend assets from a pool of collateral. It sets interest rates for those assets algorithmically using an interest rate model based on the proportion of assets lent out, which it calls the utilization ratio. Compound launched its V2 protocol in May 2019, which introduced additional assets, individual risk models, and smart contract gateways for each asset, among other features. In April 2020, Compound replaced the administrator of the protocol with community governance, empowering COMP token holders to take control of the protocol. In June 2020, Compound <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/the-agricultural-revolution-of-defi-is-underway?referrer=grid-view\">began distributing</a> COMP to users via a pioneering liquidity mining program reserving 42% of the total COMP supply to be distributed to users over the next four years.\n\nCompound KPIs across the board were largely down due to market volatility, decreasing overall loan appetite and applying supply pressure. Outstanding loans and deposits fell 42% and 32%, respectively, while liquidations skyrocketed 295% in Q1. Governance facilitated a few key changes to the protocol, including collateral factor adjustments, updating the price oracle, reducing COMP proposal thresholds, and reducing COMP rewards by 50%.\n\nCompound Markets \u2013 Macro Overview\n\nAs Q1 2022 wrapped up, many key performance indicators for Compound experienced substantial declines. The quarter ended with a 42% decline in outstanding loans, a 32% decline in outstanding deposits, a 53% decline in originations, which was already down 32% in the prior quarter, and an astounding 79% decline in deposits. Quarterly deposits hit an all-time-low in the trailing twelve months (TTM). Q1\u2019s only growth area was in liquidations with a monstrous 295% increase, totaling $134 million, largely driven by market volatility towards the end of January.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the slashing of KPIs across the board had a material impact on protocol financials. Net income, which was up 12% in the prior quarter, fell by 48%, totaling $4.9 million in the quarter.\n\nLast quarter was catalyzed by the total crypto market cap experiencing all-time-highs of $2.97 trillion. After an overheated end of 2021, the market cooled off and shaved over 40% in value, ending January with approximately $1.68 trillion in total market cap.\n\nOutstanding loans were down 42% in the quarter, dropping to levels seen back in Q1 2021, when the total crypto market cap also had a cooling period. Loans in stablecoins denominated in USDC and DAI continued to outpace loans denominated in other assets. DAI maintained its market share of overall loans outstanding on Compound as Q1 2022 ended.\n\nBorrower interest rates were relatively stable compared to the prior quarter. The average annualized interest rate was 3.85%, down from 5.02% in Q4. Rates decreased as users\u2019 demand for leverage decreased as the market cooled off in Q1. Additionally, the COMP distribution bug in Q4, resulted in assets leaving the protocol, which impacted supply and drove rates higher. Borrower interest rates maxed out at 4.48% as the market hit YTD lows.\n\nOutstanding deposits were down 32% in Q1 with the steepest decline transitioning into February. Similar to outstanding loan volumes, deposits approached TTM lows seen in Q2 2021. Deposit volumes rose in March with depositors continuing to prefer WETH.\n\nDepositor interest rates were down but stable over the quarter. This can be attributed to deposits consistently matching borrower demand. The average quarterly depositor interest rate was 1.51%, down from 2.04% in Q4. Annualized interest rates hit a low of 1.19% in Q1 and peaked at 1.87%. Interest rates saw their steepest decline at the end of January due to market volatility.\n\nCompound\u2019s aggregate utilization ratio remained relatively flat at the onset of 2022 but gradually weakened as the crypto market experienced turbulence rolling into February. Outstanding deposits declined at a slower rate of 32% relative to 42% for outstanding loans, which contributed to the utilization ratio revisiting its lows back in Q3 and Q4 2021.\n\nInterest income for the quarter deteriorated by 54% compared to Q4 2021. Coincidentally, interest and protocol income virtually experienced the same percentage changes in Q1. USDC dropped the furthest, falling 62%, followed by USDT and WBTC declining 50.8% and 50.7%, respectively. Quarterly interest income was impacted because market volatility decreased loan appetite.\n\nProtocol income was halved, dropping from $10 million in Q4 2021 to slightly under $5 million in Q1. DAI, which is responsible for over 60% of protocol income in Q1, was down 47% quarter-over-quarter.\n\nThe narrative continues across originations (new loans) for Q1. Total originations were down 53% in the quarter, led by DAI with a $2.9 billion drop (66%), over the quarter. USDC and USDT held strong but still had large declines of 48% and 47%, respectively. USDC continued to show dominance in origination volume from the prior quarter. WBTC was the only asset that grew in originations over the quarter, resulting in a 17% increase or $1.7 million.\n\nNew quarterly deposit volume took a nosedive in Q1, falling from $63 billion to $13 billion, or 79%. DAI quarterly deposits plunged by over 90%, from $44 billion to $4 billion in Q1. Compared to DAI, WBTC fell a modest 18% in deposit volume in the quarter. On-chain data suggests a user was using flash loans to arbitrage between AAVE and Compound in December 2021, driving quarterly deposits up 587%. Subsequently, another market-maker pulled DAI off the protocol in Q1, contributing to the spike in deposit volume quarter-over-quarter.\n\nDAI, WETH, and USDC are now in contention for overall quarterly deposits on Compound, with $4 million, $3.6 million, and $3.5 million in deposits, respectively. USDC was able to close the gap on WETH deposit volume in Q1, relative to the prior quarter.\n\nLiquidations on Compound peaked towards the end of January, growing 295% quarter-over-quarter. This activity was largely due to liquidations across the WETH and USDC markets resulting in increases of 270% and 665%, respectively. WETH liquidations grew from $14 million in Q4 to $106 million in Q1, largely due to ETH volatility experienced in late January. USDC markets experienced a $13 million increase in liquidations over the quarter while DAI liquidation volume was virtually non-existent in Q1 relative to the prior quarter of $3 million.\n\nCOMP token incentives fell drastically by 52% in Q1. These incentives are a key driver of depositor and borrower activity. Governance passed a proposal at the end of Q1 that would reduce COMP incentives by 50% with plans to eliminate incentive rewards. Given these plans, there should be a rapid decline in COMP token incentives in Q2.\n\nCompound\u2019s Five Largest Markets - Micro Overview\n\nCompound markets experienced various modifications in the quarter through governance. Gauntlet facilitated collateral factor adjustments across eight markets, GFX Labs introduced an updated price oracle, and a new algorithmic stablecoin market, FEI, was added to the protocol. Continuing last quarter\u2019s trend, borrowers continued to favor loans in stable assets over others.\n\nAlthough key performance indicators across the board were down in Q1, DAI continued to be the prevailing market on Compound, leading in metrics like loans outstanding, deposit volume, interest income, and protocol revenue. DAI loans outstanding decreased 47%, from $3.4 billion to $1.5 billion, while DAI\u2019s outstanding deposits decreased at a slightly higher rate of 49%, from $3.4 billion to $1.75 billion. Expectedly, quarterly originations were down 66%, from $4.4 billion to $1.5 billion. Liquidations in DAI were virtually non-existent in the quarter.\n\nAverage annualized interest rates were down from 4.5% in Q4, to 4.12% in Q1. Borrower interest rates hit a low of 3.58% and peaked at 5.10% in the quarter. The utilization ratio increased by 3.24% in Q1, resulting in borrower interest rate volatility. DAI continued to outpace loans outstanding, comprising over 42% of all loans outstanding ending the quarter.\n\nUSDC continues to be the second-largest loan market in Compound with $1.3 billion in outstanding loans, down 41%, or $2.2 billion from the prior quarter. Outstanding deposits declined at a slower rate of 37%, resulting in a utilization ratio decline of 6.2%. USDC borrower rates experienced far less volatility compared to the prior quarter with an average annualized interest rate of 3.56% in Q1. Interest rates peaked at 5.09% while bottoming at 2.62% in the quarter.\n\nOutstanding loans and deposits in USDT fell modestly compared to DAI and USDC. Loans denominated in USDT declined 14.5%, from $649 million in Q4 to $555 million in Q1. Subsequently, deposits fell 17% from $798 million in Q4 to $663 million. Utilization rates increased 2.9% over the quarter, with USDT borrower rates averaging 3.85%. After hitting a floor of 2.25%, interest rates began to increase, reaching 5.85% towards the end of the quarter.\n\nWBTC is the only asset within the top five in the protocol to experience a single-digit decline of 9.7% in outstanding deposits, falling from $1.8 billion in Q4 to $1.6 billion in Q1. In contrast, outstanding loans (USD) declined 62.7% from $134 million in Q4 to $50 million as the quarter ended.\n\nWETH continues to be Compound\u2019s largest market by deposits outstanding. Because KPI metrics were largely down in both outstanding loans and outstanding deposits during a very turbulent Q1, WETH liquidation metrics would logically benefit. WETH markets experienced a gut-wrenching 665% increase in liquidations, up from $14 million in Q4 to $106 million in Q1. This activity was mostly captured at the end of January and cooled off as the quarter wrapped up. Outstanding loans (USD) declined substantially by 61%, while outstanding deposits (USD) declined by 35%.\n\nWETH represents 36% of outstanding deposits and continues to outpace deposits denominated in other assets quarter-over-quarter.\n\nGovernance & Key Events:\n\nKey Events\n\nMakerDAO Deposit Module\n\nGFX Labs and the Compound community proposed to MakerDAO to prioritize launching a Compound DAI Direct Deposit Module (D3M), which is a Maker Protocol implementation that enables Maker to directly inject DAI into the Compound DAI borrowing market. MakerDAO voting passed a poll in January.\n\nCompound Comprehensive Protocol Audit\n\nThe Compound community recently voted to approve a long-term security partnership with OpenZeppelin, conducting audits over select Compound governance proposals along with advisory services and monitor solutions. Throughout the quarter, they\u2019ve identified several vulnerabilities which were laid out to the community with recommendations for future proposal upgrades.\n\nCOMP Rewards Dissolution\n\nA proposal was passed and executed at the end of March to reduce COMP rewards by 50% immediately and then winding down rewards to zero within a month.\n\nGovernance Decisions\n\nProposal 081 \u2013 Risk Parameter Updates for ETH (Exec. 01/18/22)\n\nProposal 081 made parameter adjustments to the ETH market, changing the collateral factor from 80% to 82.5%.\n\nProposal 082 \u2013 Dynamic Risk Parameters \u2013 Quarterly Update (Exec. 01/24/22)\n\nThis proposal reviews Gauntlet's partnership with Compound and updates its streaming grant for Q1 2022. Gauntlet proposes a quarterly fee of 8,168 COMP for the quarter.\n\nIn addition, as was requested by the <a href=\"https://messari.io/governor/proposal/9a0e2ea9-572e-424a-9395-8649253e03fe\">Compound community</a>, Gauntlet will replace its existing COMP stream with a Sablier stream. This governance proposal sets the Contributor Comp Speed to Gauntlet to zero and sets up a Sablier stream to Gauntlet instead.\n\nGauntlet has launched the Risk Dashboard, implemented five sets of parameter recommendations, published two monthly risk reviews, and safely unlocked additional borrow for Compound while maintaining protocol risk at safe levels.\n\nProposal 083 \u2013 Add Markets: FEI (Exec. 02/10/22)\n\nFEI USD was added as an algorithmic stablecoin on Compound with the following risk parameters: collateral factor 0%, reserve factor 25%, borrow limit \u2014 none, COMP rewards \u2014 none, and price source \u2014 Chainlink (Uniswap V2 FEI/ETH).\n\nProposal 085 \u2013 Risk Parameter Updates for UNI, LINK, MKR, AAVE, YFI, and SUSHI (Exec. 02/28/22)\n\nProposal 085 made parameter adjustments to six Compound assets as follows: cAAVE collateral factor from 60% to 65%, cLINK collateral factor from 70% to 75%, cMKR collateral factor from 55% to 60%, cSUSHI collateral factor from 55% to 60%, and cYFI collateral factor from 60% to 65%.\n\nProposal 087 \u2013 Oracle Update (Exec. 03/17/22)\n\nThis proposal by GFX Labs aimed to update the protocol's price oracle to the Uniswap Anchored View. Chainlink currently pays double the gas costs to maintain prices on the current oracle and the pending oracle. All existing markets retain the same configuration, and FRAX, LUSD, and RAI are introduced.\n\n*The introduction of FRAX, LUSD, and RAI to the oracle was on a best-efforts basis and exists for governance\u2019s consideration in future asset-specific governance votes. Their addition is not an endorsement or opposition to their addition to the protocol.\n\nProposal 089 \u2013 Lower Proposal Threshold to 25,000 COMP (Exec. 03/19/22)\n\nThis proposal aims to lower the Compound protocol\u2019s proposal threshold from 65,000 COMP to 25,000 COMP.\n\nThe proposal additionally sets the minimum settable proposal threshold in GovernorBravoDelegate to 1,000 (this allows for lowering the proposal threshold in the future). The new change will allow anyone with a minimum of 25,000 COMP to make formal governance proposals on-chain for votes. The proposal grants 5 COMP to Ratan to reimburse gas fees for deploying the new GovernorBravoDelegate contract.\n\nThis proposal follows Proposal 88 by GFX Labs which was canceled and aimed at lowering the proposal threshold to 10,000 COMP.\n\nBased on community feedback, there was an agreement to reduce the proposal threshold from 65,000 to 25,000 COMP. This new threshold enables an additional 17 EOAs to make proposals, empowering more community members to participate in governance and programmatically reducing the barrier to entry for delegates.\n\nProposal 090 \u2013 Risk Parameter Updates for ZRX, MKR, and SUSHI (Exec. 03/21/22)\n\nProposal 090 made parameter adjustments to three Compound assets as follows: cMKR collateral factor from 60% to 65%, cSUSHI collateral factor from 60% to 65%, and cZRX collateral factor from 60% to 65%.\n\nProposal 092 COMP Rewards Adjustments \u2013 Kickstart Rewards: Step One (Exec. 03/26/22)\n\nThis proposal aims to build on previous discussions in <a href=\"https://messari.io/governor/proposal/c461f142-2645-446a-b4ad-c93f94de13cb\">COMP Reward Adjustments</a> by ending the current COMP rewards program and starting a new COMP rewards program with the primary purpose of kickstarting new markets. This proposal will immediately cut existing COMP rewards by 50% and after one month will cut COMP rewards to zero. The proposal will introduce a program to identify interest rate models across all markets. Once the interest rate model is optimized, the team will establish an effective rewards program to kickstart new markets.\n\nThe initial objective of the COMP rewards program was to reward protocol users with tokens. While this was an effective way to onboard and reward early adopters, the practice of COMP farming for profit is not sustainable.\n\nMost COMP rewards have been distributed to mercenary capital, which they immediately sell off. This causes a great disservice to the existing users and tokenholders, ultimately diluting their share of the protocol. These incentives need to be used strategically to grow the protocol to the benefit of Compound, users, and tokenholders.\n\nProposal 092 is the first step toward launching the new rewards program. Existing rewards are being cut by 50%.\n\nGovernance Discussions\n\nGFX Lab\u2019s proposal includes a laundry list of protocol improvements \u2014 here are a few key:\n\nDeploy Compound V2 to L2s and side chains reducing gas fees and increasing accessibility\nTransition off legacy cTokens across markets, improving protocol revenue and corresponding interest rate models and bringing upside for the protocol\nAllocate resources to research, test, and upgrade existing interest rate curves, liquidation mechanisms, and developer code base\n\nCertora\u2019s Verification proposal aims to significantly and continuously improve the security of the Compound platform by offering a formal verification and path coverage tooling service to contributors and dApp developers within Compound.\u00a0\n\nGrant Program Overview\n\nThe community learned from the wildly successful Compound Grant Program (CGP) 1.0, which funded over $1 million in over 30 grants. The second iteration, CGP 2.0, is currently being designed with the vision to build the best community-led organization possible. The protocol plans to staff a full-time team to develop clear communication processes that enable more transparency across the community. However, the CGP has remained paused in Q1, due to a lack of focused resources to develop plans to launch CGP 2.0.\n\nRoad Map\n\nMulti-chain Strategy\n\nIn an effort to adapt to the rapidly changing blockchain landscape and learn from the challenges experienced during the development of Gateway, the Compound community has chosen to first establish a presence on EVM-compatible chains as fragmented multi-chain markets with shared liquidity pools.\n\nCompound Treasury\n\nScaling Compound Treasury will continue to be a focus in 2022. The Treasury is a centrally managed product built on top of the protocol. It is designed for non-crypto-native businesses and financial institutions, operating as an institutional on-ramp to Compound markets.\n\nCompound III\n\nCompound III is an EVM compatible protocol that enables supplying of crypto assets as collateral in order to borrow the base asset. The initial deployment of Compound III is on Ethereum and the base asset is USDC. The supply and borrow interest rates are bound by separate curves that have a utilization \u201ckink\u201d affecting the rate calculation. Accounts can only earn interest by supplying the base asset.  \n\nThe evolution of Compound relies heavily on community contributions through governance. Even if many members agree on what protocol improvements should take place, efforts can be stalled due to the allocation of resources and compensation structures of contributors.\n\nClosing Thoughts\n\nCompound\u2019s overall activity was largely influenced by the volatility of the broader market in the quarter. Retreating from Q4 market all-time-highs, users\u2019 appetite for loans and deposits declined sharply in Q1. This sentiment appears to be the primary driver in the decline of both borrower and deposit interest rates as well as protocol income, consequently resulting in triple-digit percentage increases in liquidations from the prior quarter.\n\nWith COMP rewards being slashed by 50% at the end of Q1 and plans to be ultimately brought to zero in the following month <a href=\"https://messari.io/governor/proposal/c461f142-2645-446a-b4ad-c93f94de13cb\">(Proposal 092),</a> Compound markets should start to stabilize, shaking out mercenary capital who are the primary beneficiaries of incentive rewards. These protocol participants immediately sell off rewards, which can negatively impact COMP price and tokenholders. As a response, Compound is aiming to optimize markets across the board and introduce effective incentives to kickstart new markets. These actions should result in a net positive for COMP tokenholders, fostering a healthier and more sustainable protocol.\n\nThe recent onboarding of OpenZeppelin\u2019s security partnership and Gauntlet\u2019s risk dashboards are great examples of collaboration through governance. For Compound to remain competitive with the likes of AAVE and MakerDAO, critical protocol improvements in the near term are paramount. As COMP incentives diminish in the coming month, community members will need to continue driving strategic initiatives through governance to attract new users, increase market efficiencies, and ultimately improve the protocol\u2019s dominant position in the market.\n\n  \n\nThis report was commissioned by Compound, a member of Protocol Services.

In The Sandbox, anyone can create 3D assets like buildings, in-game items, and non-player characters. These assets can then be used to build diverse experiences including games, music and fashion events, social activities, quests, art exhibits, and contests. The Sandbox offers creators a set of intuitive tools that require no background in coding or in designing experiences. These tools include a 3D editor for making and animating items, a game maker for making experiences, and a game client. The Sandbox is actively working on making these tools as user-friendly as possible in order to unleash the creativity of its community. For instance, the 3D editor combines different in-game tokens to create user-generated assets.\n\nThese user-generated assets are ERC-721 non-fungible tokens that can be monetized on open markets. The Sandbox ecosystem leverages a series of tokenized gaming features including: a digital in-game currency used for purchases, monetization, and asset creation (i.e., SAND); ownable digital land within The Sandbox virtual world (LAND); a combination of LANDs to create a larger plot (ESTATE); a bundle of assets and scripting logic to create interactive experiences (GAMES); 3D virtual images created by players (ASSETS); tokens burnt to give attributes to assets (GEMS); and tokens burnt to create ASSETS (CATALYSTS). Thanks to the tradeable nature of these user-generated assets within its virtual world, The Sandbox has robust in-game economics.\n\nIn addition to owning the assets that they build, creators will be able to make experiences available on LAND parcels in The Sandbox Metaverse. The long-term goal of The Sandbox is to enable creators to build immersive experiences. The possibility to monetize LAND and in-game experiences has attracted investors to acquire LAND. The top owners of LAND include large investors in The Sandbox, such as Binance, Everyrealm, and Galaxy Interactive, as well as NFT communities such as Whale, MetaKovan, and Cyber Kongz. In addition, The Sandbox is actively forming partnerships with businesses that are willing to develop experiences within its virtual world and become early adopters. These partnerships span a suite of business verticals including gaming, music, entertainment, fashion, and lifestyle, to name a few. Partnership examples are presented in \u201cThe Sandbox Ecosystem: Notable Events\u201d section below.\n\nMacro Overview\n\nThere is a finite amount of Sandbox LAND \u2014 166,464 parcels. New LAND parcels are subject to primary sales \u2014 they are sold to private entities (in partnerships) or released for sale through auctions. Notably, 65% of all the LAND parcels have already been distributed, up 2% from Q4 2021.\n\nAs the volatile Q1 2022 has come to a close, LAND secondary sales volume decreased by 54% compared to the previous quarter. To put this into perspective, the secondary sales volume in Q1 2022 is still up 865% relative to Q3 2021. This quarter's decrease is the result of the metaverse hype starting to settle down since Meta's rebrand announcement in October 2021. The market is merely finding its equilibrium, and demand for LAND remains healthy despite the buying frenzy of Q4 2021.\n\nAt the same time, relative to Q2 2021, primary LAND sales grew 23%. The subject of primary sales are LAND parcels that are newly issued and are usually either sold to partners or through auctions. Still, primary LAND sales volume ($16 million) accounted for only 12% of the marketplace LAND sales volume ($136 million) in Q1 2021.\n\nIn terms of usage, The Sandbox launched the Alpha Season 2 of its gameplay in March 2022. Notably, during this launch, The Sandbox reached 2 million registered users. Considering the launch lasted four weeks, tracking its active daily or monthly users isn\u2019t useful at this point. Instead, unique LAND buyers may be an alternative proxy for the interest in LAND utility.\n\nThe number of monthly active LAND buyers is back to the more sustainable levels seen before Meta\u2019s announcement in late October 2021. This poses the question of what drives the value of digital land in The Sandbox virtual world, given that only a limited number of its users are currently being able to host and monetize experiences.\n\nIn our <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/the-state-of-the-sandbox-q4-2021\">previous quarterly report</a>, an in-depth analysis uncovered that LAND ownership is fairly concentrated, with the top owners holding onto their parcels. A follow-up question is whether this holding behavior is specific only to top owners. This quarter\u2019s report analyzes the LAND holding time and discusses the potential implications on the value of land in virtual worlds.\n\nMicro Overview \u2014 Holding Behavior\n\nIn an effort to understand LAND holding time, one may consider various clusters of buy & hold behavior. In this sense, one can think, for instance, of long-term buying behavior as holding onto parcels for longer than one year, while buy & sell could be described as holding periods shorter than 30 days. The current breakdown of the LAND holding time reveals that 7% of purchasers hold LAND for longer than one year, while 11% of purchasers hold LAND for less than 30 days. At the same time, the vast majority (72%) of LAND buyers hold the asset for 1\u20133 months.\n\nIn other words, 83% of buyers choose to sell their LAND sooner than 3 months after the purchase. This hints towards profit taking as a driver for LAND owners to buy & sell their assets. Below we analyze the profit taking behavior by looking at buy & sell transactions that took place within 30 days. For each of these buy & sell transactions, the difference between the sale price and the corresponding buy price is summed up on a daily basis.\n\nNote that peak profit taking occurred on Nov. 24, 2021 \u2014 roughly one month after the Meta rebrand announcement. Since then, profit-taking behavior returned to sustainable levels. Additionally, since October 2020, only 19 days have seen negative aggregate profitability, with Dec. 31, 2021 having the largest negative balance. One may consider LAND buying potentially as a call option on The Sandbox gaining massive user traction.\n\nDespite the high interest in The Sandbox gameplay experiences signaled by the 2 million user registrations, <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/the-digital-land-debate\">the case for digital land</a> is still in its early days in terms of the building of experiences. Intuitively, making immersive experiences available in The Sandbox may be a potential catalyst for sustainable value creation and capture. In this sense, users are eagerly awaiting immersive crypto-consumer gameplay experiences to be launched. Creators are well positioned to build immersive virtual experiences and make them available for users. In terms of capturing that value, owners may acquire specific LAND parcels with the hope that hosting virtual experiences on those parcels may, in turn, drive increased user activity. This could further create a flywheel for immersive experiences to be adopted on a large-scale, which, in turn, would boost the value of LAND parcels over the long-term.\n\nHowever, it is not presently possible for creators to make experiences available to others using LAND parcels. This may hinder real demand for the time being. While most LAND buyers may be initially inclined to hold, the absence of practical means to monetize LAND though hosting of experiences may tempt them to take profits. It is thus important for The Sandbox to continue building the backbone for immersive experiences and increased accessibility by users.\n\nFor The Sandbox to continue to grow and thrive, immersive experiences will need to be created and adopted on a large-scale. In this sense, an important metric to follow will be the number of active users of full gameplay releases that are not bound to specific time intervals.\n\nThe Sandbox Ecosystem: Notable Events\n\nPartnerships\n\nBrands show no signs of fatigue in joining The Sandbox ecosystem. Driven by the vast possibilities of building and monetizing experiences, a series of brands have announced partnerships with The Sandbox on several verticals, notably: gameplay (Ubisoft, SM Media, and Ethernity), music (Warner Music Group), entertainment (SHIBUYA109), diversity and inclusion (World of Women), sports and gaming engagement (HSBC), and fashion and lifestyle (Gucci, Arianee). Developing further partnerships will remain a focus area for The Sandbox for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe Sandbox Alpha Season 2\n\nIn March of 2021, The Sandbox launched Alpha Season 2 of its virtual world. The gameplay was bound to 4 weeks and enabled users to get Alpha Passes and earn SAND, the utility and governance token of The Sandbox. For the first time, The Sandbox reached the milestone of 2 million registered users. As part of Alpha Season 2, The Sandbox released 200 quests and 35+ experiences that were available to PC and Mac users that registered with a free account. The Sandbox looks to continue growing its user base with the upcoming Season 3 announcement.\n\nStaking on Polygon\n\nThe Sandbox introduced gasless mSAND staking in February. While SAND already maintains a liquidity pool on Uniswap, this program allows everyone on Polygon to get a share of the 500,000 mSAND weekly rewards. In addition, mSAND holders who provide liquidity to the program will be eligible to share a monthly allocation of 500,000 mSAND. Further staking rewards have been introduced during The Sandbox Alpha Season 2.\n\nRoadmap\n\nLooking ahead, The Sandbox has a few notable developments in the pipeline.\n\nProgressive Decentralization\n\nThrough progressive decentralization, The Sandbox aims to incentivize its community to come up with their own experiences. That is, The Sandbox is inspiring its community to build experiences for players and potentially unleash the next generation of massively successful games. While not yet deployed, The Sandbox DAO will be able to vote on Foundation grants as well as make decisions on game developments. The Sandbox DAO will be governed by both SAND token holders and LAND owners.\n\nNetwork Effects and Ecosystem Growth\n\nAs LAND will continue to be gradually opened and distributed in 2022, The Sandbox needs to grow its network effects. There will be a sustained effort in securing further partnerships and growing its ecosystem. The aim is to scale and attract various businesses \u2014 metaverse agencies, fashion houses, virtual real estate marketplaces. Ideally, these businesses would establish their own sales, leading to job creation and a wider variety of experiences available to players in The Sandbox.\n\nLaunch of Public In-Game Experiences\n\nThe Sandbox is still in alpha, which means that in-game experiences are presently unavailable. Once available, these in-game experiences are expected to further grow The Sandbox user base. Throughout the following quarters, The Sandbox plans to allow users to publish experiences directly on their LAND parcels so that other players can access them.\n\nClosing Summary\n\nThe Sandbox ecosystem continued its growth in Q1 2022, with notable partnerships and over 2 million registered users upon launching the Alpha Season 2 gameplay. This past quarter, The Sandbox also experienced the effects of the overall market pullback. As the metaverse hype started to settle down, marketplace sales of digital land came back to sustainable levels. The ambitions of The Sandbox are wide-ranging, with the potential to become one of the largest experience-based entertainment platforms.\n\nBased on its numbers and partnerships, The Sandbox remains at the forefront of virtual worlds. But, there remain some potential headwinds. The real test for the long-term viability of The Sandbox is building the technology backbone for more immersive experiences for its future players. With the success of the Alpha version launch, now is the time to test what works, track the adoption of features, and to be strategic about the roadmap and its execution. The ability to quickly pivot and adopt the most suitable strategy for the technical development of its virtual world will be key. For The Sandbox to become a true entertainment metaverse, immersive experiences will need to be created and adopted on a large-scale.\n\nThis report was commissioned by The Sandbox, a member of Protocol Services.

Whereas most competitors use consensus mechanisms in the Classical or Nakamoto families, Avalanche differentiates itself through its creation and implementation of a new consensus family known as \u201cAvalanche consensus.\u201d Following years of research, the Avalanche mainnet was launched in September 2020 and featured the release of a multichain framework utilizing three chains (the P, X, and C chains). Each chain plays a critical and unique role within the Avalanche ecosystem while providing the same capabilities of a single network.\n\nAs a follow-up to the <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/state-of-avalanche-q4-2021?referrer=asset:avalanche\">State of Avalanche Q4 2021</a> report, this report will revisit developments and events from the prior quarter, analyze the network\u2019s most recent quarterly performance, and give insight into the coming months. A full appendix of data tables is available at the end of the report.\n\nThe First Quarter Narrative\n\n<a href=\"https://messari.io/article/state-of-avalanche-q4-2021?referrer=asset:avalanche\">Q4 2021</a> was a period of high growth for the Avalanche network. With the Ethereum\u2013Avalanche bridge, major exchange listings, high-profile partnerships, and the Avalanche Rush liquidity program, the network was positioned to grow its user base and welcome new participants into its economy. As individuals and institutions piled in, Avalanche recorded all-time-highs in active addresses, daily transactions, total value locked (TVL), and market capitalization. As we moved into the new year, additional growth strategies and developments were on the horizon, but it was unknown whether the network would continue growing, experience a downturn, or show signs of stabilization.\n\nUltimately, Q1 2022 consisted of continued growth and the stabilization of network usage, financial performance, and network infrastructure. The outcomes were attributed to several key developments: the continued deployment of Avalanche Rush, the Blizzard ecosystem fund, Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) subnet development, and the introduction of the Multiverse subnet incentive program and Culture Catalyst fund. As existing enterprise partners such as Deloitte began to implement business solutions, new partnerships were formed over the quarter.\n\nNetwork Overview\n\nAcross the board, Avalanche experienced modest growth compared to the prior quarter, and its key metrics stabilized across the network. While the market cap was relatively flat (-5.4%), the network experienced continued uptrends in usage, revenue generation, and a move towards favorable fundamental valuation. Average daily transactions nearly doubled over the quarter (+82.8%), total revenue grew by 72.7%, and the price-to-sales (P/S) ratio continued to settle down, with the ratio of price relative to revenue moving from 160x to 91x.\n\nAs a result, daily active addresses did not reverse course, and instead, adoption continued as active addresses reached an all-time-high of 140,000 in January. For perspective, Avalanche had more active users in the first week of January than in all of October 2021. The network averaged around 70,000 daily active addresses during Q4 and reached a stable range with an average of 92,000 during Q1.\n\nSimilar to Q4, transaction activity on the network followed a similar pattern to daily active address growth. On aggregate, Avalanche's average daily transactions rose from 473,000 last quarter to 865,000 in Q1, which is ~ 74% of Ethereum\u2019s roughly 1.17 million. Daily transactions continued their upward trend with additional DeFi application launches and the rollout of GameFi subnets such as DeFi Kingdoms Crystalvale and Crabada. Ultimately, while on testnet, Crabada would become the top transaction driver on Avalanche during Q1. Beyond DeFi and GameFi, total 24 hour NFT volume surpassed $1 million for the first time, while the NFT market cap broke $110 million.\n\nThroughout 2021, the network experienced volatility in average daily transaction fees. With further releases of Apricot, transaction fees have since stabilized, averaging around $0.67 per transaction. Apricot is intended to facilitate \"verifiable pruning,\" a process where nodes can securely compact historical transactions. It features a fee mechanism that enables transaction costs to be low and predictable for users. While stable, transaction fees have been trending upward in tandem with daily transactions. With more anticipated releases of Apricot, we should expect to see average transaction fees continue to stabilize and trend downwards.\n\nFurther, the continued launch of subnets should put downward pressure on transaction fees. Subnets are a horizontal scaling strategy that aims to validate Avalanche blockchains running in parallel, enabling transaction order, and increased performance by splitting up network traffic allowing for optimization and more control over transaction fees.\n\nIntuitively, as daily active addresses and transactions grew, total revenue increased. Revenue grew by 72.7% over the quarter, and cumulative revenue became a more significant fraction of the network FDV. To put it into perspective, cumulative revenue as a percentage of FDV is 20x from a year ago, which signals that fundamentals like network revenue are moving more in line with market value.\n\nAvalanche\u2019s network revenue (transaction fees) is atypical for smart contract platforms. Rather than distributing transaction fees to validators, 100% of fees are burned from the network\u2019s circulating supply. This drives value to all token holders through increased scarcity rather than compounding the balances of validators and delegators. In other words, revenue growth should put upward pressure on the market value of AVAX. The question is just how statistically significant the spread between revenue and market value is. With that in mind, as fundamental value (as opposed to speculative value) becomes a more substantial part of market value, a strong correlation between revenue and market value should theoretically exist.\n\nMost notably, a spike in daily revenue on November 22, 2021, was accompanied by a spike in FDV. The same relationship exists between circulating market cap and price. Additionally, the spread between the two variables tightened during Q1, with occasional spikes in revenue once again accompanied by spikes in FDV. As the spread tightens, the network usage becomes more correlated to the market value. This correlation could indicate that the network is moving closer to fundamental value versus speculative value. If the relationship holds, then revenue will have a significant relationship with network value.\n\nSince June 2021, engaged stake and nominal staking yields have been stable, with an average annualized yield of ~10%. One of the last significant token unlocks occurred during March, but there was no indication of a change in engaged stake. Should those tokens engage or disengage in staking, there could be additional volatility in yield over the near term.\n\nEcosystem & Development Overview\n\nHeading into 2022, Avalanche DeFi was expected to be fueled by the ongoing Avalanche Rush program and the new $200 million Blizzard ecosystem fund. Over the course of Q1, Pangolin (PNG), an Avalanche native DEX, and Terra (LUNA) joined the Rush program and combined to bring TerraUSD (UST) to the Avalanche ecosystem. In total, $2 million in AVAX incentives were combined with additional LUNA and PNG rewards to incentivize usage.\n\nContinued network adoption was also evident in Avalanche development activity with unique contracts deployed and contract deployers having grown by 60.9% and 13.1%, respectively. Although development marched forward, TVL declined by 5.5%.\n\nThe TVL decline would have been more drastic if not for the continued growth and development in the DeFi sector. TVL is highly sensitive to overall market valuations. While TVL on Avalanche experienced a slight decline, top DeFi protocols Aave, Benqi, and Trader Joe experienced TVL declines of 4%, 18%, and 20%, respectively. Their collective TVL declined by 12% \u2014 more than twice the total Avalanche DeFi ecosystem\u2019s decline. Essentially, the continued growth and development of newer and smaller protocols in the Avalanche DeFi ecosystem offset the market forces negatively impacting top protocol TVL. Ultimately, like other metrics in the Avalanche ecosystem, TVL appears to have also stabilized at around $11 billion.\n\nAave, Trader Joe, and Benqi solidified their positions as the top three DeFi protocols after joining Rush in Q4. Collectively, these three protocols experienced a 12% decline in TVL, which is greater than the decline of the entire Avalanche DeFi ecosystem. The disconnect between the greater decrease in TVL across the top DeFi protocols and the lower decline of the entire DeFi ecosystem can be attributed to additional launches of DeFi services on the network, such as the launch of Platypus Finance (PTP).\n\nPlatypus Finance is a stableswap protocol that was the fastest growing DeFi application over the quarter, having grown from just $10 million to over $750 million in TVL, representing a ~7,500% increase. Platypus also became one of the top 10 applications generating network transactions on Avalanche.\n\nAdditional launches and Rush deployments, such as Pangolin and Terra, helped prop up Avalanche\u2019s TVL despite overall market declines. The other notable trend across Q1 was the steady long tail of DeFi protocols on Avalanche. Entering Q1, 60 protocols had amassed $1 million TVL, up from just 29 from the prior quarter. Exiting Q1, 60 protocols maintained the $1 million TVL mark. Despite the flat to down quarter, the number of applications with recorded TVL grew from 100 to 150.\n\nQ1 marked the beginning of Avalanche\u2019s highly anticipated GameFi subnet launches. Crabada quickly passed 5,000 users, measured by the number of unique wallet addresses interacting with the application's smart contracts. Daily transactions grew from 60,000 to over 400,000 over Q1, measured by transactions made to Crabada\u2019s smart contracts. Daily volume generally ranged between $130,000 and $1.5 million as measured by the total amount of incoming value to the application's smart contracts. Finally, the TVL in the application's smart contracts neared $50 million by the end of the quarter. Ultimately, the emergence of new DeFi and GameFi applications was fueled by continued growth in developer metrics.\n\nQ1 developer activity in the Avalanche ecosystem aligns closely with the network's overall TVL growth and recent entry into GameFi. The number of unique contracts deployed grew by 60.9% quarter over quarter and reached an all-time-high in March, just as Crabada and DeFi Kingdoms launched their subnets. The number of unique contract deployers slowed on a month-to-month basis but still managed to grow by 13.1% quarter over quarter. With the deployment of the Multiverse and Culture Catalyst funds, March's surge in contract deployments should continue through Q2 2022.\n\nThe growth of events in the Ava Lab\u2019s Github repository grew significantly (76.4%) throughout Q1. Given this was the greatest increase to date, the number of events indicates that the network\u2019s core team is accelerating the infrastructure buildout.\n\nStaking and Decentralization Overview\n\nThe security of PoS networks like Avalanche requires users to lock up the network\u2019s native tokens and participate in validation duties. A distributed network of validators and active participants can help ensure the network functions as intended.\n\nAfter a downwards trend at the beginning of 2021, engaged stake settled at around 60%, which has been maintained through Q1 2022.\n\nStaking amounts during Q1 were relatively uneventful, with average stake changes in the single digits quarter over quarter. Such predictability and lack of volatility are generally good for network health. Validator stake was consistently about 5.85 times greater than the amount of delegated stake. The amounts of unresponsive validator stake were higher than average on a few days, but the total amount of offline stake never came close to levels that could compromise the network.\n\nWhile the average staking amount was relatively flat, there was a material increase in the average number of validators and delegators. The average validator count grew from 1,138 to 1,259, representing a 10.6% increase in network security participants. The number of average validators joining the network stayed at about 11% growth each quarter. This stability is indicative of a growing, decentralized network.\n\nEach new Avalanche subnet will be required to validate on the Avalanche P-chain. As more subnets launch, the average number of validators should increase in tandem. The average number of delegators also grew from 16,459 to 17,179, representing a 4.4% increase. The number of delegators consistently outnumbered the number of validators, consistent with other PoS networks that support native delegation. The average number of offline validators continued to decline, decreasing by 14.9% over the quarter. Ultimately, low volatility in the network\u2019s staked AVAX combined with an increase in validators and delegators is a sign of healthy decentralization.\n\nThe Nakamoto coefficient is a metric first introduced by Balaji Srinivasan to quantify the decentralization of blockchain networks. The coefficient represents the minimum number of actors who can collude to disrupt the network. For Avalanche, the Nakamoto coefficient equals the number of validators that control one-third of the network\u2019s stake. Avalanche\u2019s Nakamoto coefficient hovered in the low 30s to begin 2021 but fell to 25 in June. Since this decline, the coefficient has remained stable in the upper 20s, putting Avalanche above the industry average for other Layer-1 networks.\n\nCompetitive Analysis\n\nCurrently, the Layer-1 space is a competitive race between new and legacy protocols to achieve the maximum possible network speed at the lowest possible cost and with the greatest degree of security. Each competitor has focused on maximizing these activities while making a range of trade-offs regarding centralization. The ideal blockchain would be fast, secure, widely used, and adequately decentralized.\n\nThe core technical advancements, developer activity, and ecosystem growth strategies may separate one L1 from another. Here, we evaluate Avalanche\u2019s progress versus the top five EVM compatible chains (including Avalanche) by TVL. The methodology used to derive this peer group is simply by grouping the EVM chains with the largest TVL, seeing as today, DeFi is the sector driving the majority of each network\u2019s economic activity.\n\nAvalanche experienced the lowest decline in value in terms of market cap and closed in on BNB Chain market share while further separating itself from Fantom and Polygon.\n\nSimilarly, Avalanche\u2019s daily revenue trended upward. At the same time, all other EVM chains experienced a decline, allowing for Avalanche to close in on BNB Chain and further separate from Fantom and Polygon.\n\nAvalanche\u2019s P/S ratio declined over the quarter, while other chains aside from Fantom experienced an increase in this valuation metric. From a relative valuation perspective, Avalanche is now more in line with Ethereum with a P/S of 91x versus Ethereum\u2019s 81.5x.\n\nBoth Avalanche and Fantom reached similar levels in Q1 daily transactions. Ethereum has held steady at ~1.17 million transactions per day, with Avalanche now reaching ~74% of Ethereum\u2019s average daily transactions. With the incentive programs taking hold and subnet launches on the way, Avalanche has an interesting opportunity to surpass Ethereum over the next quarter.\n\nQ1 was a flat to down quarter for the crypto market, with aggregate TVL decreasing from $240 billion to $230 billion. Avalanche\u2019s TVL declined at the second slowest rate among the top EVM chains, only trailing behind Fantom. A significant portion of Avalanche\u2019s stability came at the expense of Ethereum, BNB Chain, and Polygon, each declining by double-digit percentages. As the above chart illustrates, Avalanche closed in on BNB Chain in this area. The Avalanche Mcap/TVL ratio also ended among the lowest. As a measure of network value relative to TVL, it signifies a closer relationship between the network value and the DeFi economic activity occurring on the network.\n\nKey Events, Catalysts, and Strategies for Ecosystem Growth\n\nQ1 2022 proved to be another significant quarter for the Avalanche ecosystem. Indeed, growth strategies and development activity contributed to Avalanche's ecosystem growth, as evidenced by the data presented in the previous sections of this report. The results can be attributed to several key developments:\n\nThe continued deployment of Avalanche Rush\nDeployment of the Blizzard ecosystem fund\nCustom EVM subnet development\nIntroduction of the Multiverse program and Culture Catalyst fund\n\nJanuary 2022\n\nAvalanche's Q1 began with the launch of the Subnet-Ethereum Virtual Machine, a custom VM that enables users to easily and rapidly create their own, configurable EVM-compatible blockchain. By the end of the first week of January, Pangolin announced plans to launch its own subnet. During the first week of January, not only was the Avalanche ecosystem gearing up for subnets, it was introducing additional enterprise partners. Ava Labs entered into a strategic partnership with Turkey's electronic vehicle manufacturer Togg to design and build smart contract-based services to improve autonomous mobility.\n\nBy the middle of January, Bitwise, a prominent crypto index fund manager, reconstituted the Bitwise 10 Large Cap Crypto Index and added AVAX. Days later, Terra passed a proposal to bring UST to Avalanche with Liquidity Mining Proposal #3. Further ecosystem collaboration came about when Celsius Network announced support for Avalanche, allowing users to borrow against AVAX from a centralized provider. Further, 1inch, a widely used DeFi aggregator, was deployed on Avalanche.\n\nJanuary concluded with the first subnet launches on Avalanche with Spaces, a website allowing users to store and share links, images, and files all on-chain, and WAGMI, a subnet demo that is a high-throughput testbed for EVM optimizations. Finally, to round out the month, Anchor Protocol, the largest DeFi protocol on Terra, proposed and passed a UST borrowing strategy whereby sAVAX entered the platform as its newest collateral asset.\n\nFebruary 2022\n\nAs reported in Q4 2021, one of renowned street artist Banksy's most iconic pieces, Love is in the Air, became a fractionalized NFT on Avalanche. The NFT was made possible by Particle, which partnered with Avalanche to bring fine art on-chain in November. By February, the Banksy NFT generated interest and purchases by celebrities such as Paris Hilton. The Particle Banksy collection would later sell out in March.\n\nAlso reported in Q4, a multi-year agreement with Andretti Formula E Autosports marked the first title sponsorship from a blockchain company with a Formula E team with a natural alignment between organizations committed to sustainability. By mid-February, the Avalanche Andretti team made its debut at the Mexico City E-Prix, the Formula E World Championship.\n\nMarch 2022\n\nMarch was a pivotal month of Q1. The uptick witnessed in daily transactions was largely due to the launch of the Crabada and DeFi Kingdoms subnets with Crabada running testnet and DeFi Kingdoms live on mainnet. To support the growth and development of subnets, the Avalanche Foundation announced the launch of Avalanche Multiverse, a $290 million (~4 million AVAX) incentive program. The first subnet to receive incentives through the Multiverse program was DeFi Kingdoms. Subsequently, Wildlife Studios joined the Multiverse program and will be expanding its flagship game, Castle Crush, onto its own subnet, intending to integrate NFTs and tokens into the game.\n\nAt the end of March, the sold-out Avalanche Summit took place in Barcelona, Spain, with sponsors including Circle, Terra, and Bridge Tower Capital, to name a few. During this time, the Avalanche Foundation and Web3 social media platform Op3n announced a $100 million creator fund called Culture Catalyst. The fund intends to help creative projects launch on Avalanche and Op3n. The program's first recipient will be musician Grimes, who plans to create an \"intergalactic childrens' metaverse book.\"\n\nEcosystem Challenges\n\nQ1 did not present any drastic challenges like those that came with the growing pains of Q4. As reported last quarter, the Avalanche C-chain recorded new highs for daily transactions which caused the network to temporarily experience higher than usual transaction fees. This quarter, network optimizations known as Apricot quickly became apparent as average daily transaction fees declined and stabilized. With that in mind, transaction fees were trending upward towards the end of Q1 as daily transactions increased.\n\nThe anticipated solutions to scaling and lowering costs include governance, pruning, and subnet development, which will involve removing a gas limit mechanism, among other optimizations. The launch of subnets is in motion, and the horizontal scaling approach with subnets takes place will influence how transaction fees trend going forward.\n\nThe Road Ahead\n\nCurrently, Avalanche does not maintain an updated public-facing roadmap, so the protocol developments are not prescribed. However, it is expected that Avalanche Rush will continue to drive DeFi growth, Blizzard will support overall ecosystem expansion, Multiverse will drive subnet development, and Culture Catalyst will bring creative talent to the ecosystem.\n\nIt is also anticipated that core platform upgrades will continue. Significant upgrades (Apricot) are being implemented in six phases, following a successful series of Phase 5 in Q1. All phases of Apricot broadly represent one of the solutions (pruning) to the optimizing transaction fees.\n\nAs discussed during the Q4 Analyst Call, user experience improvement is of high priority. As part of this effort, Ava Labs announced details about <a href=\"https://messari.io/intel/event/a6060efe-af6c-4977-8590-6fa4aac69678\">Core</a>, a free, non-custodial wallet explicitly created for applications on Avalanche with native support for subnets. The first iteration of Core is a browser extension, with the second being the Core mobile wallet expected to be released in early Q2. Ava Labs also announced that the Avalanche Bridge will enable support for Bitcoin, allowing BTC holders to transfer their BTC onto Avalanche securely. Bitcoin support is also scheduled to go live on mainnet in Q2. Ultimately, Ava Lab\u2019s goal is to make the user experience as seamless as possible, and the Core wallets and bridge developments are the first steps.\n\nAvalanche on-chain governance is also still in development. AVAX will, at some point, be used to provide on-chain governance for critical network parameters where participants can vote on changes to the network and settle network upgrade decisions democratically. Some of these parameters will include factors such as the minimum staking amount, minting rate, and transaction fees.\n\nWhile all Avalanche incentive programs may continue to catalyze ecosystem growth and garner more project launches and partnerships, significant technological advancements are critical for the teams developing the Avalanche infrastructure. The continued development of subnets and the launch of Core will play a key role. For subnets to flourish, Core will need to successfully support extended functionality for subnets, such as native bridging.\n\nClosing Summary\n\nNetwork usage, financial performance, development activity, and network infrastructure continued to grow and stabilize during Q1 2022. The growth was fueled by Avalanche Rush, the Blizzard ecosystem fund, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) subnet development, the Multiverse subnet incentive program, and the Culture Catalyst fund. Additionally, partnerships formed in Q4 with enterprises like Deloitte began implementing business solutions on Avalanche while more partnerships were formed. Altogether, Avalanche showed signs of capturing market share versus top EVM-compatible chains across several key metrics over the quarter.\n\nAcross the board, Avalanche experienced growth, and its key metrics stabilized across the network. While the market cap was relatively flat, the network experienced continued uptrends in usage, revenue generation, and a move towards favorable fundamental valuation. Further, continued network adoption was also evident in Avalanche development activity, with unique contracts deployed and contract deployers growing significantly.\n\nAvalanche incentive programs may continue to provide a catalyst for ecosystem growth. These programs may attract more project launches and partnerships, however, significant technological advancements are at the forefront of the teams developing Avalanche infrastructure. Significant developments to monitor going forward will be the continued development of subnets and the launch of Core. For subnets to flourish, Core will need to successfully implement its objectives to support extended functionality for subnets, such as native bridging. Ultimately, as with all Layer-1 networks, tracking the growth of the Avalanche network and its progress towards optimization and user experience will be top of mind looking ahead into the next quarter.\n\nThis report was commissioned by Ava Labs, a member of Protocol Services.

The protocol is recognized as a pioneer among decentralized exchanges (DEXs), first for its popularization of the X*Y=K constant product pricing curve of pooled liquidity in V2 \u2013 and subsequently for its concentrated liquidity and staggered trading fee features in V3. The constant product pricing curve has since been implemented across many other DEXs in the industry. The concentrated liquidity model and fee tiers continue to remain relatively unique across DEX applications.\n\nTo quickly recap, AMMs pair tokens into pools balanced by the aforementioned algorithm. Liquidity providers (LPs) can deposit funds into those liquidity pools where traders make trades by swapping tokens in and out \u2014 in effect, making trades with the pool. In exchange for providing liquidity, LPs earn transaction fees paid by the traders.\n\nImportant updates to the protocol in the past quarter include the rapid growth of trading activity on Polygon\u2019s Proof-of-Stake (PoS) chain (hereinafter: Polygon). Though Polygon was the last of Uniswap\u2019s scaling solutions to launch in 2021, Uniswap V3 transaction volume quickly surpassed other notable DEXs on Polygon, such as SushiSwap, QuickSwap, Balancer, on fractions of the total value locked (TVL) for other DEXs. Q1 2022 saw some important governance proposals as well: launches of V3 on Gnosis Chain and Celo have passed temperature checks and will be up for an on-chain vote shortly. One should also reasonably expect additional expansion proposals later this year.\n\nAfter a volatile Q4 trading quarter, 2022 represents an opportunity for normalization. Benchmarking quarter-over-quarter metrics will shed light on how Uniswap and its LPs respond to concerns of a bear market. A full appendix of quarterly data is available at the end of the report.\n\nMacro Overview\n\nOn the whole, Uniswap trading volume in Q1 2022 was 53.5% lower than the previous quarter. This corresponds with the global crypto market, which hit its peak market capitalization in Q4 2021 at $3 trillion and has since come back down to $2 billion. When token prices go up, trading volume generally increases as retail inventors become more interested; when token prices decrease, retail investors lose interest in crypto. And unlike Q4 2021, which saw both the resurgence of NFTs and all-time highs for BTC and ETH, trading activity in Q1 2022 has been more muted.\n\nOverall market liquidity dipped in Q1 2022, but to a lesser degree than volume. V2 was the only network to see a liquidity decline over the quarter, falling by 25.7%, while all the others saw nominal increases at a small scale. Since V2 includes more long-tail token pairs, a decline in V2 liquidity does coincide with lower retail trading volume. Meanwhile, market liquidity really shined in Uniswap\u2019s so-called scaling solutions, particularly Polygon. Polygon jumped almost 81.7% compared to the end of Q4 when it had just launched. The implications of Polygon\u2019s big win will be revisited throughout the report. Arbitrum and Optimism each saw growth too at 72.9% and 34.7%, respectively.\n\nPolygon\u2019s liquidity growth is particularly impressive given the lack of liquidity mining incentives for users in Q1. For context, when the initial governance proposal was made, up to $15 million was set aside by the Polygon team for liquidity mining purposes and another $5 million was prepared to support the ecosystem. As of the first week of April, these incentives have now been implemented. Only time will tell how much of a boost it'll give to Polygon's existing success.\n\nDaily LP fees fell 36.2% in Q1 2022 after jumping 54.0% in Q4 2021, resulting in final quarter-end numbers similar to the end of Q3 2021. Q4\u2019s numbers were such outliers due to the mainstream popularity of NFTs and all-time highs for both BTC and ETH. On the non-Ethereum front, Arbitrum gives Polygon a serious run for its money while Optimism lags behind. This data implies Polygon sees more trading of blue-chip token pairs (and thus, lower fees) while popular Arbitrum pairs trade in the higher fee tiers.\n\nTotal trading markets also continued to climb from the previous quarter, across all products from V2 on Ethereum to each of Uniswap\u2019s non-Ethereum networks. V2 continues to make up the vast majority of total available markets. V3 on Ethereum and Polygon comprise 11% of active markets while Optimism and Arbitrum remain negligible. As with market liquidity, Polygon grew the quickest in Q1, jumping almost 300% from the previous quarter. Given all the data, it\u2019s clear Uniswap has found a home on Polygon.\n\nMicro Overview\n\nThe markets on V3, while fewer in count, continue to trade more blue-chip token pairs. Trading activity on V3 also continues to rise on a quarter-over-quarter basis.\n\nTop V2 Markets\n\nThe top four most actively traded V2 markets for Q1 2022 were the following pools:\n\nUSDC/WETH\nUSDT/WETH\nSAITAMA/WETH\nFXS/FRAX\n\nTogether, the four pools represent less than 0.001% of the count of tradeable V2 markets but comprise 19.4% of total trading volume. Activity \u2013 and trends \u2013 from these four markets can be seen as leading indicators for the direction of the overall V2 ecosystem. However, given the trading pattern similarities USDT/WETH shares with USDC/WETH, further analysis of the pool was replaced in favor of the FXS/FRAX market for the purposes of this report.\n\nUSDC/WETH\n\nData from USDC/WETH shows trading volume continuing to decline after the launch of V3. V2 volume in the most recent quarter only accounted for 3.2% of total volume, only a tenth of V2 volume in Q2 2021. A total of $2.7 billion was traded in the V2 pool in Q1 2022, a 24.5% decline from the previous quarter. The capital efficiency of V3 makes it likely USDC/WETH trading activity on V2 will continue to decline and give way to further volume increases in its V3 counterpart.\n\nThe chart above represents our methodology of tracking LP profits/losses. Three scenarios were evaluated to compare the profitability of providing liquidity to this pool: a user providing liquidity for 30-, 90-, and 180-day windows. These windows were rolled through the entire last year to compare the profitability of these actions across time. For each window period, the corresponding impermanent loss caused by price change in the first and last day of the window was deducted from the equivalent yield generated from trading fees. The result is a moving net profit metric displayed above.\n\nThe USDC/WETH pair is a prime market to take a liquidity stake in, given the high volume of trades facilitated by the pool. Because most price fluctuations would be hedged by trading fees earned by LPs, one could expect decent returns when trading volume is high.\n\nOf the 365 days since Q2 of last year, only 52 of the rolling 180-day returns would have yielded losses for LPs who would\u2019ve chosen to retract their liquidity on any of those days. Even fewer days would have led to a loss for shorter-term LPs: for rolling 30-day LPs, the total impermanent loss would have exceeded fees for only 45 days of the year and only 12 days for those supplying rolling 90-day LPs.\n\nIn Q1 2022 alone, performance gets even better. All rolling 90- and 180-day LP positions over the entire 90 days in Q1 would have yielded a positive profit. For the rolling 30-day LP, every position would have been profitable, except for January 22-27th and March 5th.\n\nFXS/FRAX\n\nBoth tokens in the final V2 pool, FXS and FRAX, are tokens used by the <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/frax-a-fractional-algorithmic-stablecoin\">Frax Protocol</a>, an algorithmic stablecoin protocol built on a hybrid seigniorage model. FRAX is the actual stablecoin pegged to the US Dollar; FXS is the governance and value capture token used as partial collateral for FRAX. As a hybrid model, FRAX is collateralized by both the FXS token and a fraction of another stablecoin.\n\nThe extent to which the percentage of underlying collateral made up by FRAX and USDC or another stablecoin is determined by the collateral ratio, which changes with demand for FRAX. If FRAX supply is expanding, less stablecoin is needed; if FRAX is retracting, a higher collateral ratio of stablecoin is needed.\n\nWhat\u2019s important to know is that Frax has an FXS buyback program (Frax1559) for excess collateral. This occurs when yields are earned by the protocol\u2019s stablecoin collateral, causing total collateral to increase above the required collateral ratio. Frax uses the extra earned capital to mint new FRAX tokens and buy back outstanding FXS tokens.\n\nThus, the trading volume of the Uniswap FXS/FRAX pool is driven by the Frax1559 buyback program and should be relatively stable as long as FRAX remains successfully pegged to the US Dollar. Its emergence as a top-three traded pair this quarter reflects this stability while other volatile pools saw their trading volume sink. In total, trading activity in Q1 rose 6.9% for the most recent quarter after increasing 243.1% in Q4 2021.\n\nAnother factor adding to increased trading was chatter of a pending airdrop. The airdrop is for the upcoming FPI token. A snapshot was taken on February 20th of FXS of those who staked FXS tokens or were LPs of the FXS/FRAX pool. Those who heard about airdrop eligibility might have contributed to market activity by trading for FXS tokens or contributing to the liquidity pool.\n\nUnfortunately for LPs, the FXS/FRAX pool suffers mixed results. Trading fees were not strong prior to the implementation of FXS1559 while the token\u2019s price fluctuated wildly. The combination resulted in heavy losses across all three rolling time frames. Once the buyback program was initiated, trading volume picked up substantially. Though FXS price volatility didn\u2019t go away, the additional trading fees earned by LPs began to counteract impermanent loss, turning total LP fees positive.\n\nSAITAMA/WETH\n\nLast quarter, we described the rise of SAITAMA/WETH as a beneficiary of the November 2021 trading surge. After all, SAITAMA, as we noted, is the token for another of the doge-like projects that were so popular among retail investors, but its continued success has subverted expectations.\n\nNot only was SAITAMA/WETH a top-performing market in Q4 2021, it continued to be so for Q1 2022. That said, the asset pair did see overall trading volume fall 67.6% from the previous quarter. The trading volume growth of the previous quarters could not be sustained after a 2,500%+ increase in Q3 and a 700%+ increase in Q4. This highlights the broader trend of retail trading in the crypto markets: H2 2021, and Q4 2021 in particular, were very strong for memecoins and the general market, while Q1 2022 experienced a pullback.\n\nMarket liquidity for SAITAMA/WETH fell almost 40% from the previous quarter. Yet this decline still is less than the decline in trading volume. This all occurred while the price of SAITAMA fell by more than 75% over the quarter. LPs that kept their capital in the pool could have done so for many reasons, including the possibility of high fees or forgetting to close their market-making position.\n\nLPs who contributed liquidity to the SAITAMA/WETH pool saw a mix of positive and negative yields throughout the rolling 30-, 90-, and 180-day time frames. In line with expectations, most of the positive returns came in or after Q4 2021 when the trading volume began to pick up. Roughly 66%, or 62 out of 90 days in the quarter, led to positive returns for LPs over the 30-day time frame. The number of positive days increased to 82% for anyone supplying liquidity over a 90-day period but decreased to 32% for 180-day LPs, respectively.\n\nTop V3 Markets\n\nUnsurprisingly, the most active V3 markets are the USDC/WETH, USDC/USDT, and WBTC/WETH markets, which contributed 61.0% of V3 volume. Each market sheds a unique light on a different part of the crypto ecosystem: 1) ETH activity, the cornerstone of smart contract networks; 2) stablecoin markets, and 3) the relationship between the two largest crypto assets.\n\nUSDC/WETH\n\nThe USDC/WETH market is the predominant blue-chip stablecoin/ETH pair and the best indicator for ETH trading activity. It\u2019s worth noting that the USDT/WETH pair is also very active on Uniswap. In fact, it is the second most actively traded market. Demand for these three tokens is particularly high on Uniswap as most trades are denominated in those assets, which makes those markets the central routing point for market activity.\n\nTotal USDC/WETH V3 transaction volume for Q1 2022 amounted to $81.5 billion, an increase of 6.3% from the previous quarter. The majority of the increase came from the 0.05% fee tier, which jumped from $65.8 billion to $73.2 billion. The increase was partially negated by the decline in trading in the higher 0.30% tier. This trend highlights how competitive exchanges are. As noted in the Q4 2021 iteration of this report, capital competes with capital for fees and ultimately drives trades towards lower fee tiers.\n\nDividing the total fees by each dollar of liquidity highlights the yields an LP can expect to earn. A quick, high-level comparison of return on assets between the USDC/WETH V2 and V3 pools shows how much more capital efficient V3 is. V2 returns $0.04 for each dollar deposited, or 4.0%; the same calculation for V3 returns $0.12 for every dollar, or 12%. Note this doesn\u2019t account for each V3 LP\u2019s concentrated liquidity, but holistically summarizes V3\u2019s ability to generate a 3x higher return on its liquidity.\n\nAlthough Polygon found plenty of success in Q1, Arbitrum has a significant amount of liquidity available for USDC/WETH V3. Arbitrum has $16.2 million, i.e., 28.3% more liquidity than Polygon at $12.6 million. Because Arbitrum has been around longer, Polygon\u2019s liquidity has recently grown at a faster daily rate \u2014 and it will be supercharged even more with Polygon\u2019s liquidity mining program going live next quarter.\n\nUSDC/USDT\n\nUniswap was not competitive in the stablecoin DEX market until the implementation of its 0.01% trading fee tier. Once that became active, Uniswap could draw the attention of traders looking to pay the cheapest fees on highly correlated stablecoin pairs. The visual above clearly shows when that occurred.\n\nStablecoin trades in the USDC/USDT market jumped 60% overall against Q4 2021. This followed a 114.1% increase compared to Q3, more than tripling in nine months. Unsurprisingly, 87.3% of trading volume, or about $8.5 billion, came from the lower 0.01% fee tier. Liquidity, meanwhile, only increased 11.2% over the quarter.\n\nIn last quarter\u2019s report, we wrote about Uniswap\u2019s decision to implement the 0.01% fee tier as a boost for stablecoin trading volume. Analyzing the data above, Uniswap does appear to now be more competitive with Curve as a result of its enhanced capital efficiency.\n\nPrior to the launch of V3, Uniswap was doing a median of 8.54% of the combined volume between Uniswap and Curve. After the launch of V3, but prior to the implementation of the 0.01% fee tier, Uniswap stablecoin trading across both V2 and V3 operated at a median of 30\u201333% trading dominance. That median ratio now stands at 48.3% today, practically on parity with Curve. Uniswap\u2019s share of the two combined DEX\u2019s volume even reached a high of 71.4% on one day. Given the importance of stablecoins in the DeFi ecosystem, Uniswap\u2019s gains in this area are exciting to watch.\n\nWBTC/WETH\n\nTrading volume of the WBTC/WETH V3 pool fell 20.2% compared to Q4 2021. Notably, volume in the 0.05% pool fell 28.9% while volume in the higher 0.30% fee tier was mostly consistent across quarters. Liquidity in the smaller fee tier did jump 57.3% whereas the higher fee tier only moved up 13.7%. Since investor sentiment has noticeably cooled, some investors might be choosing to take a yield-generating LP position, earn fees on these (more stable) blue-chip assets, and re-evaluate the state of the market when better opportunities arise.\n\nBehind the scenes, Ethereum continues to show signs of losing its complete dominance of V3 trading. Over the last four quarters, the share of transaction activity occurring on Ethereum has gone from 100.0%, to 99.8%, to 98.4%, and finally, 96.4% in Q1 2022. Once again, the emergent winner in Q1 2022 continues to be Polygon. The WBTC/WETH protocol dominance level for Polygon shows the network starting at around 5% of all trading activity and peaking to 10% midway through the quarter. In total, the 3.6% gain by Polygon and other blockchains isn\u2019t earth-shattering, but it will be something to track as users continue to move towards cheaper scaling solutions.\n\nGrant Program\n\nUniswap approves grants almost every week, but to avoid publishing a blog post for each new funding, grants are batched together into waves. In Q1 2022, Uniswap released Wave 6 and Wave 7 of their Uniswap Grants Program. Note, the quarter in which batches become publicly shared does not necessarily correlate with the quarter they were made (i.e., some grants from the batches may have been funded in Q4 2021).\n\nWhat stands out from the quarter is the total grant funding distributed in Wave 6. The previous high occurred in Wave 5 with $946,000. Wave 6 was more than a 2.5x increase from this level, equating to $2.4 million of funding. More than $1 million was dedicated to the \u201cRFP and Challenge\u201d category. Some of the most notable grants from Wave 6 and Wave 7 are below:\n\nOther Internet (Governance Experiments) \u2013$1,000,000\n\nOther Internet received a $1 million grant from Uniswap Grants Program to further their research of Uniswap\u2019s open governance. In the summer of 2021, Other Internet completed initial research on the off-chain governance occurring in the protocol\u2019s Discord channels. The additional funding will support a series of action-oriented proposals to strengthen governance practices, many of which will ideally be implemented throughout crypto. Specific deliverables include a redesign of the governance process, a new committee for UGP, and insights into the protocol treasury. Money from this grant is expected to last the upcoming year.\n\nUnigrants Community Analytics Program \u2013 $250,000\n\nA quarter of a million dollars was set aside to fund winners of a new analytics-focused program. The objective of the program is to reward UNI token bounties to contributors who could produce analytics for the protocol. The purpose of the program is to use these analytics to further onboard new users into the community. A committee of five individuals, ranging from UGP members to independent analysts, were chosen to review applications and select bounty winners. More information about the Community Analytics Program can be found in the next section.\n\nTeam Secret \u2013 $112,500\n\nUniswap Grants Program decided to continue its partnership with Team Secret for the first half of the fiscal year 2022 after the team\u2019s top-three finish at The International, the biggest global DOTA tournament. As announced in June 2021, the partnership includes the team creating educational content around Uniswap and organizing future technology launches. The goal was \u2014 and continues to be \u2014 aimed toward reaching new audiences, especially those in the digitally native gaming community.\n\nArt Basel (Crypto Onboarding) \u2013 $68,500\n\nFunding was provided to set up a crypto booth at the upcoming Art Basel in December 2021. Occurring in Miami, the booth was dedicated to helping event attendees get onboarded with crypto. People were around to assist curious participants on setting up their first wallet, claiming their first event POAP, learning how to get into NFTs, and more. The end result saw over 300 people get onboarded into crypto and the DeFi ecosystem.\n\nCommunity Analytics Program\n\nAs stated prior, the Community Analytics program is designed to encourage more analytics for the growth of the Uniswap community. Multiple rounds of bounties have already occurred from the time the grant was approved till the end of Q1 2022.\n\nBounty #1: Uniswap on Polygon \u2014 Compare the deployment of Uniswap V3 to Polygon with its metrics on Ethereum. Include other DEXs in the analysis. The final product should display growth in a clean dashboard.\nBounty #2: Uniswap V3 LP Behavior \u2014 Create a dashboard analyzing LP behavior for Uniswap V3. Given the capital efficiency of the product, Uniswap wanted to better understand the fee tier, volume, and liquidity preferences of LPs.\nBounty #3: Uniswap V2 vs. V3 (L1) \u2013 Over any select time frame, provide analytics highlighting key metrics between the use of V2 compared to V3. V3 KPIs should be broken out by Layer-1 so Uniswap can better understand the drivers behind the adoption of its markets.\nBounty #4: Uniswap Governance \u2013 Study points of decentralization for Uniswap Governance, including all off-chain and on-chain voting procedures. This bounty was earned by selecting three specific data points and conducting an analysis of all relevant governance factors.\n\nThe Community Analytics Program will continue with Round 3, which is currently taking place. Submissions were due on April 1st, 2022. Winners will be announced one week later on April 8th.\n\nGovernance Updates\n\nFeb. 14, 2022 \u2014 <a href=\"https://messari.io/governor/proposal/252348af-cf95-436d-9566-08f2fc6fbc95\">Deploy Uniswap V3 on Harmony [Failed]</a>\n\nThe decision to approve Hermes DeFi with a Uniswap V3 codebase use grant was rejected for not meeting quorum. The proposed idea would have allowed another alternative DEX to use Uniswap\u2019s code to create an AMM on Harmony. Uniswap would, in turn, receive a plethora of benefits, including Hermes token ownership, trading fees, a perpetual trading pool on the AMM, and more. The community\u2019s concerns centered on how this would not have been a native Uniswap app launch, compared to other \u201cDeploy Uniswap to XYZ Blockchain\u201d proposals. Since sentiment was mostly positive, however, the decision to launch on Harmony \u2014 either through a third party or natively \u2014 might potentially be revisited if a quorum can be met.\n\nFeb. 21, 2022 \u2014 <a href=\"https://messari.io/governor/proposal/133d04f0-9d18-43b4-bac4-b8d2fdc5a6af\">Fund the Fee Switch Activation [Failed]</a>\n\nUniswap\u2019s fee switch mechanism is a known topic of debate. At the heart of the question is when and how Uniswap will activate its famous fee switch to distribute protocol revenue to UNI token holders. This proposal offered to create a fund to oversee the application of the fee switch mechanism for both V2 and V3 pools but was rejected by the community.\n\nMarch 12, 2022 \u2014 <a href=\"https://messari.io/governor/proposal/d63fe95c-2775-4b18-978a-0e08a9737127\">Provide Voltz with Uniswap V3 Additional Use Grant</a>\n\nProposed back in Q4, the decision to provide Voltz Protocol with the codebase use grant was successfully executed in March 2022. The codebase granted in this vote will be used for Voltz\u2019s new DeFi primitive for the trading of leveraged interest rate swaps. In return for approving this governance measure, Voltz has agreed to offer 1% of its token supply to Uniswap; if the protocol is successful in attracting liquidity, both Uniswap and Voltz stand to benefit.\n\nMarch 19, 2022 \u2014 <a href=\"https://messari.io/governor/proposal/1b536e61-d995-4503-acbc-5a2020694e41\">Deploy Uniswap V3 on Celo</a>\n\nA temperature check gauging interest in deploying V3 on the mobile-first, environment-focused Celo blockchain was passed in March 2022. Included in the proposal, if ultimately passed, will be $10 million in financial incentives, a third of which would be set aside for environmentally friendly assets such as tokenized carbon credits. By approving the temperature check, Uniswap and the Celo Foundation hope to move to a final vote shortly.\n\nMarch 25, 2022 \u2014 <a href=\"https://messari.io/governor/proposal/30f90fe0-b8ce-4e57-847e-c3379eee3f33\">Deploy Uniswap to Gnosis Chain</a>\n\nThe community voted to pass another temperature check regarding the deployment of Uniswap V3 to Gnosis Chain. Gnosis Chain recently underwent a rebranding effort from xDai Chain in an effort to grow usage of the network. Part of this proposal would include funding from the Gnosis Chain team in the form of $10 million from the Gnosis DAO ecosystem fund. Money received from the DAO will be allocated for a tailored liquidity mining program intended to attract users. A final vote should follow a similar timetable as the one needed to approve V3\u2019s launch on Celo.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nUniswap\u2019s first quarter of 2022 was primarily marked by organic growth on the Polygon network, exploring ways to expand V3 to other networks, and the pullback of overall trading across the larger crypto market. That last point is what community members may find concerning: if less trading activity occurs, won\u2019t that be detrimental to Uniswap?\n\nThe answer is a combination of yes and no. Exchanges always want to see healthy trading volume but the reality is Uniswap is well-positioned to deal with any correction in crypto markets. The fact users can enter into LP positions and earn yields suggests an engagement with the protocol will continue. Tracking how the protocol responds to a changing macro investment environment will be at top of mind for the rest of the year.\n\nThis report was commissioned by Uniswap Labs, a member of Protocol Services.

The framework will enable marketplace and royalty fees generated from the Origin Story marketplace to be distributed to OGN stakers.\n\nSector Returns\n\nAfter three consecutive weeks of positive market sentiment, all sectors are underwater this week. Gaming was the biggest loser as it started showing signs of weakening momentum last week. Last week it was the only sector with a negative return, and this week it took the heaviest losses at -13.28%. Web3 was the other category within sector returns that had a double-digit loss week, shedding 9.99%.\n\nTop Assets\n\nDogecoin (DOGE) was the only asset within the top 10 assets by market capitalization that ended the week with a positive return. The original dog coin went so far as reaching a 29% gain this week at $0.1796 but then giving most of it back, closing the week with a 4.5% return. Avalanche (AVAX) was the laggard of the group, ending the week with a 10.4% decline.\n\nDeFi Assets\n\nIt was a very different outcome for the DeFi sector this week compared to last week. Whereas it was the best-performing sector last week, it was among the bottom three this week. Even though the category\u2019s performance was not impressive this week, there was one asset that took the spotlight: Anchor Protocol\u2019s ANC token. The Terra-based lending and borrowing platform saw its token end the week with a 29.5% gain. Impressive considering the rest of the assets in the category finished the week in the red. THORChain (RUNE) was the biggest loser, marking a 17.3% loss for the week.\n\nSmart Contract Platforms\n\nNEAR Protocol stole Waves\u2019 (WAVES) thunder this week as the NEAR token closed with a 24.6% gain, eyeing to break all-time-highs. It was the only asset within the top smart contract platforms by market capitalization sector that ended the week with a positive return. The catalysts behind NEAR\u2019s recent rally are news of a $350 million funding round led by Tiger Global and rumors that NEAR will launch its native stablecoin (USN), an algorithmic stablecoin with a similar mechanism to Terra\u2019s UST and staking APY of 20%. TRON performed the worst within the category and took the last spot with a 13.7% loss.\n\nCurrencies\n\nOnly two currencies made it above water this week with Dogecoin (DOGE) leading the group and Monero (XMR) securing the second position. As mentioned earlier; Dogecoin\u2019s (DOGE) price went as high as 29% at $0.1796 before returning most of the gains. The dog token ended the week with a 4.5% return. The currencies that did not end the week in positive territory traded fairly close to each other throughout the week, closing within a 6.9% range (BTC at -4.9% and BCH at -11.8%).\n\nWeb3\n\nAudius (AUDIO) was the only winner within the Web3 sector this week with half of the assets in the category reporting double-digit losses. The decentralized music streaming platform has been gaining popularity recently, which has been contributing to its appreciation in price. The token saw its price rise as much as 58.7% before returning most of the gains. It was still enough to secure the number one spot with a 10.6% return. Theta (THETA) secured the endmost position with a 16.3% decline.\n\nGaming\n\nDvision Network was the clear outperformer of the gaming sector this week as the virtual reality content ecosystem\u2019s DVI token price rose as high as 54% at $0.5799 but subsequently returned most gains. The performance was enough to help keep its spot in the first place and finished the week with a 21.6% return. Axie Infinity enters its second week in a row where the AXS token comes in last, following the hack of its cross-chain bridge.\n\n", "references": [{"name": "Guillermo Avil\u00e9s", "url": ""}], "published_at": "2022-04-08T20:32:00Z", "author": {"name": "Guillermo Avil\u00e9s"}, "tags": null, "url": "https://messari.io/article/weekly-recap-ending-april-7"}, {"id": "a22902fc-30fd-4c5c-8bdb-7bb83ec01f5c", "title": "Weekly Recap Ending March 31", "content": "Notable Messari Intel Updates\n\nThe Acala team has announced that both <a href=\"https://messari.io/intel/event/dd43249c-7bc3-4c0b-84ec-94fa39e741d2\">Acala and Karura will integrate with Wormhole</a>.

The price of the sale would be approximately 1.6 million USDC. The rationale for this sale is that the value of the veNFT\u2019s use has lessened. SpookySwap would use the added capital to hire more developers and deepen BOO liquidity.  \n\nSector Returns\n\nThis week marks the third in a row where markets have seen a general positive return with the exception of the gaming sector. The DeFi sector was the best performer of the week, bringing in a return of 13.91%. Next up was the Web3 sector with a return of 10.27%. The gaming sector has been amongst the top performers for the past two weeks, securing multiple double-digit positive return weeks. This week saw a retracement for the sector as it was the only one to end the week on negative territory (-1.27%).\n\nTop Assets\n\nSolana (SOL) was the best performer amongst the top 10 assets by market capitalization this week, securing a 21.3% gain. Avalanche (AVAX) was the next best performer with an 11.4% return. Following closely was Terra (LUNA) which has continued its rally and now currently sits in ATH territory with a weekly return of 10.5%. Ripple\u2019s XRP performed the worst this week and was the only asset to end in a decline within the category (-3.2%).\n\nDeFi Assets\n\nIt has been an action-packed week for the DeFi space as the sector continues gaining momentum. Half of the top DeFi assets posted double-digit returns, with only one asset on the red. Leading the charge among the best-performing sector of the week was THORChain (RUNE) which brought a weekly return of 45.7%. The cross-chain liquidity protocol\u2019s asset has seen its price rise more than 277% since its February bottom. The second best performer was Aave (AAVE), which went on a rally following the release of V3, an upgrade that adds support to six blockchains. The lending and borrowing protocol ended the week with a 27.1% return. FRAX was the laggard of the group with a -1.5% return.\n\nSmart Contract Platforms\n\nWave\u2019s meteoric week comes from the back of three key events surrounding the Layer-1 blockchain. The first is the Waves 2.0 migration, the launch of a $150 million ecosystem fund and a partnership with Allbridge. However, critics have raised concerns regarding the sustainability of the ecosystem, pointing to the fact that the rise in interest in the blockchain was due to the rise in TVL, which was driven by Neutrino (an algorithmic price-stable \"assetization\" protocol built on top of Waves) buying up WAVES. Waves (WAVES) closed the week with a 155.0% gain. Cosmos (ATOM) took the last spot with a -3.2% loss.\n\nCurrencies\n\nThe top currencies sector posted the narrowest set of returns of the week, with returns within a 17.7% range. Leading the sector was Stellar (XLM) with a 10.2% return, the only asset within the category with a double-digit gain. Monero (XMR) was next up with a 4.2% return, followed by Bitcoin (BTC), returning 3.7% on the week. Zcash underperformed compared to the rest of the group, securing the last spot with a 7.5% loss.\n\nWeb3\n\nFilecoin (FIL) was on track to post a +35% return this week but at the last moment gave some of those returns back. It was enough to bring the open video infrastructure asset to compete with Theta Network (THETA) for the first spot. Filecoin ultimately secured the spot for the best performer with a 26.2% return while Theta Network (THETA) ended the week with a 23.9% return. Helium (HNT) took the last spot of the group with a -3.2% return.\n\nGaming\n\nSmooth Love Potion (SLP) was the best performer of the gaming sector this week, bringing in a 13.3% return for the week. Close by was Enjin (ENJ) which posted a weekly gain of 12.2%. Ultra (UOS) took the third spot with a 9.8% gain. Axie Infinity (AXS) took the last spot this week as it posted a loss of 11.9%, mainly driven by the news surrounding the Ronin bridge hack in one of the largest crypto exploits to date.\n\n", "references": [{"name": "Guillermo Avil\u00e9s", "url": ""}], "published_at": "2022-04-01T13:55:00Z", "author": {"name": "Guillermo Avil\u00e9s"}, "tags": ["Macro"], "url": "https://messari.io/article/weekly-recap-ending-march-31"}, {"id": "030b9757-f41b-481e-ab9f-41ee70222480", "title": "Filecoin Has It: An Ecosystem Overview", "content": "Key Insights\n\nFilecoin offers decentralized storage and cloud services on a global, open market. It has the largest market share in terms of used storage and network capacity.\nThe ecosystem has grown to over 330 projects up from \u200b\u200b40 at the start of 2021. Various use cases have emerged, including NFTs, Web3, gaming, metaverse, and audio/video.\nFilecoin aims to offer the foundation for data-intensive Web3 services through verifiable storage, content retrieval, compute, and programmable apps coming to the fore.\nThe main challenge for Filecoin is to pass the test of time and prove its reliability.\n\nData Availability and Integrity\n\nAlmost every Internet user relies on centralized services to store and process data. This has two major shortcomings: users are no longer in full control of their data, and it is hard to verify the integrity of the data. To address these shortcomings, a new generation of protocols and peer-to-peer networks have enabled decentralized storage and cloud services. One prominent protocol of this kind is Filecoin, which provides a cryptoeconomic guarantee that the data exists and can be accessed at any time. \n\nPut simply, Filecoin is a peer-to-peer version of AWS that regularly verifies data availability and integrity. This is made possible by deals negotiated on open markets for data services.\n\nDeals in Open Markets\n\nA storage deal is like a service level agreement (SLA) enforced on the Filecoin blockchain. Storage deals are agreements where users pay fees to storage providers to store their data. The terms of the deal include the fee amount and the duration of the storage deal.\n\nThe open-market environment incentivizes storage providers to offer their storage capacity in an efficiently priced way. That is, prices are determined by supply and demand dynamics, rather than a fixed pricing structure. To incentivize storage providers to participate in deals, Filecoin rewards them with the network's native token (FIL).\n\nFilecoin has two functions to keep data safe. First, it uses a cryptoeconomic guarantee that verifies the storage with zero-knowledge proofs. Second, it uses an economic penalty: if the data is unretrievable or the storage fails, storage providers are penalized through locked-up collateral. To enforce this, the Filecoin protocol requires storage providers to submit two ongoing verifiable cryptographic proofs. Proof of Replication first verifies that the data has been fully replicated. Upon success of this initial check, storage providers use Proof of Spacetime every day to prove that a random piece of data is still stored and available for retrieval throughout the deal\u2019s lifetime. Any failure leads to a penalty.\n\nTo retrieve data, users pay a retrieval provider to fetch the data for them. Unlike storage deals, which are handled on-chain, retrieval deals may happen off-chain. This results in a faster data retrieval process.\n\nTechnology in a Nutshell\n\nFilecoin is built on top of the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), which serves as the Filecoin network\u2019s distributed data storage and sharing layer. Although some people use Filecoin and IPFS interchangeably, there are important differences between the two.\n\nPut simply, IPFS is like torrents on steroids. Similar to torrent trackers, IPFS uses a fingerprint of the data. Unlike torrents, IPFS leverages a single global peer-to-peer network. IPFS essentially tells users where their data is, but it lacks a built-in mechanism to incentivize data storage, which led to the development of Filecoin in the first place. Filecoin thus complements IPFS and facilitates an open market for storage with a guarantee, essentially making Filecoin the incentive layer of IPFS.\n\nIPFS may be regarded as a peer-to-peer version of HTTP, with an important twist. Traditional URLs and file paths identify a file by its specific geo-location on a server. IPFS uses content addressing to store data decentrally. It references a file by what\u2019s in it, i.e., by its content. A content address is unique and is the result of hashing, which is essentially the cryptographic compression of content into a long string of characters. When retrieving a file, the network only needs the file\u2019s hash to locate the nodes storing that file\u2019s content.\n\nNetwork Dynamics\n\nThanks to its open-market policy and incentive mechanisms, Filecoin has been able to attract significant storage capacity. Regardless of market conditions, Filecoin\u2019s committed storage capacity has grown steadily since 2020 to over 16,000 PiB, which is equivalent to approximately 65,000 copies of Wikipedia or 1,600 Netflix movie archives as of March 2022. The network capacity comes from over 3,900 decentralized storage providers distributed around the globe.\n\nWhat\u2019s the Demand for Filecoin?\n\nDemand for Filecoin comes from both Web2- and Web3-specific storage use cases. Adding up how much storage capacity is bound in deals quantifies the demand for Filecoin. However, when analyzing the underlying content in the storage deals, it is difficult to distinguish between useful storage and generated randomness as a way for storage providers to abuse the network.\n\nTo increase the amount of useful storage capacity on Filecoin, the Filecoin Plus incentive program was developed. The program incentivizes storage providers to participate in verified deals by increasing their share of the block rewards over time.\n\nStorage deal inflows grew from 400 TiB in October 2020 to over 7,600 TiB in March 2022, and Filecoin Plus clearly contributed to that growth. Since Q4 2021, there has been a transition from Filecoin Regular deal inflows (unverified data) to predominantly Filecoin Plus verified deal inflows.\n\nUsed storage on the network (i.e., active storage deals) has grown steadily from 0.25 PiB (1 PiB = 1024 TiB) in October 2020 to 45 PiB in March 2022. As shown below, over 26 PiB have resulted from Filecoin Plus deals, representing 57% of the total active deals on the network. \n\nThe recent flippening of Filecoin Regular deals by Filecoin Plus deals indicates that the verified data incentive mechanism is working as planned. The sudden drop-off in terms of active Filecoin Regular deals in December 2021 was a result of several storage providers going offline. The loss has been compensated by other storage providers picking up and contributing to the growth in Filecoin Plus active deals as of January 2022. As a result, the total deal volume fully recovered.\n\nWhile supply vastly exceeds demand, storage capacity is only one side of the story. What is equally important is the amount of used storage on a network. With 45 PiB of used storage and 16,000 PiB of storage capacity, Filecoin has a storage utilization ratio of 0.3%. To put these network metrics into perspective, competing decentralized storage providers, like Sia and Storj, have 6 PiB and 14 PiB, respectively, of network capacity. Total storage usage by Sia and Storj stands at 2.2 PiB and 8.6 PiB, respectively. In terms of storage utilization ratio, Sia and Storj surpass Filecoin at 36% and 60%, respectively. Although Arweave has 0.05 PiB of data stored, it has not been included since its data stored is negligible compared to the other storage networks: while it is currently growing from a relatively small base, it does not have network capacity per se.\n\nWhile the introduction of the Filecoin Plus program is a step forward, there is a concerted effort to incubate new businesses and use cases for building on Filecoin. The Filecoin ecosystem is channeled towards onboarding a large variety of use cases: from decentralized storage for NFTs, to music and video streaming, to metaverse and gaming.\n\nEcosystem of Developers and Builders\n\nFilecoin is actively supported by several organizations with the common goal of growing the Filecoin ecosystem. These organizations come together to form the Ecosystem Working Group. The responsibilities of the Ecosystem Working Group participants include maintaining and upgrading the underlying protocols, supporting the growth of the ecosystem, and facilitating governance. The most prominent organizations in the group include Protocol Labs, Filecoin Foundation, and Outercore. An overview of the main participating organizations is shown below.\n\nThese organizations have been actively developing a funnel of developers and builders through activities such as hackathons, accelerators, grants, mentorship and growth support. The funnel is designed to help early-stage projects and teams get to the point where they are ready to receive funding and investments. As a result, over 330 projects are currently being built on Filecoin and IPFS. Below is a breakdown of the funnel, showing projects\u2019 progression over time, grouped by their maturity stage.\n\nThe main objective for 2022 is to enable as many early-stage projects in the ecosystem to translate into full-fledged businesses -- i.e.,  advancing from initial stages all the way through Series D and beyond.\n\nAs a whole, the ecosystem has grown significantly in terms of integrations with applications and clients, tools for developers, and infrastructure. Recently, the Ecosystem Working Group has prioritized making it easier for end-users and developers to work with Filecoin. This has led to the development of services like Textile Powergate, Estuary, and NFT.Storage. All use cases in the Filecoin ecosystem are available here. A map of selected ecosystem players is shown below.\n\nSource: Filecoin\n\nIn terms of notable initiatives in 2022, the forthcoming launch of the Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM) is worth highlighting. FVM is set to unlock programmable storage primitives (e.g., storage bounties, auctions), cross-chain interoperability bridges (e.g., to Ethereum, Solana, NEAR), data-centric DAOs, as well as Layer-2 solutions (such as reputation systems, data availability sampling, computation fabrics, and incentive-aligned Content Delivery Networks).\n\nMain Use Cases Leveraging Filecoin\n\nThe Filecoin ecosystem is large and rapidly expanding, positioning itself to become the backbone of the decentralized web. With the rising demand for cloud storage, Filecoin provides a decentralized alternative to the popular centralized platforms. Numerous additional use cases have emerged, and new ones are guaranteed to materialize in the near future. Four major categories have already found high demand: (1) NFT and Web3 storage, (2) permanent storage and Web2 datasets, (3) metaverse and gaming, and (4) audio and video.\n\nNFT Storage\n\nDuring the summer of 2021, NFTs entered the mainstream spotlight. Driven by network effects, NFTs dominated the crypto landscape in the form of social media profile pictures, fine art, collectibles, music, and more. Interestingly, a large number of NFTs generally point to off-chain storage locations for their metadata since storing it on-chain isn\u2019t feasible. Shortly after the 2021 hype, it became evident that a large portion of NFT metadata was not being stored in a decentralized, immutable manner, putting the content and value of the NFTs at risk. To address this shortcoming, NFT.Storage was developed.\n\nNFT.Storage utilizes Filecoin and IPFS to provide a simple decentralized storage solution specifically for NFT content and metadata. It focuses on perpetual redundant storage through dedicated IPFS servers managed by NFT.Storage and Filecoin. By participating in the Filecoin Plus incentive program, NFT.Storage is able to offer an unlimited amount of storage for NFTs, free of charge.\n\nLaunched in April 2021, NFT.Storage has already supported the permanence of over 40 million uploads of NFT data, totaling up to more than 260 TB of data. The simplicity of the service has allowed a wide range of users from individual artists to large marketplaces such as OpenSea, MakersPlace, MagicEden, Holaplex, Jigstack, and Galaxy to take advantage of perpetual NFT storage.\n\nWeb3 Storage\n\nFilecoin aims to become the storage layer of Web3. To that end, Filecoin has ongoing collaborations and storage bridges with various major blockchains and smart contract platforms. One of the most recent examples is <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/polygon-a-multi-sided-approach-to-zk-scaling\">Polygon</a>. The goal of the partnership is to meet the storage and infrastructure needs of developers for games and NFT-related Web3 projects. Notably, Polygon developers can easily use Filecoin through the storage bridge. Filecoin has also seen growing traction in the Solana ecosystem with a number of protocols and NFT marketplaces offering native support, including Metaplex, Magic Eden, and Holaplex.\n\nSource: Filecoin\n\nTo simplify building Web3 apps on Filecoin, the team launched Web3.Storage. It allows developers to store and retrieve data directly on Filecoin instead of dealing with complex decentralized storage networks. \n\nWeb3.Storage uses redundancy to store data across multiple Filecoin miners and geographically-distributed nodes on IPFS. These IPFS nodes are run by the Web3.Storage team. In addition, the service offers free storage indefinitely with unlimited data. This is made possible by the economics of the Filecoin Plus mechanism. Overall, Web3.Storage has experienced steady growth since its launch, growing from 3 million uploads in August 2021 to 16 million in March 2022.\n\nPermanent Storage & Web2 Datasets\n\nSimilar to Arweave, Lighthouse allows Filecoin users to permanently store files for a fixed price. In addition, the Filecoin Virtual Machine will enable permanent storage to be automated into smart contracts. A prominent use case for permanent storage is data archival. Given Filecoin\u2019s scale, the goal is to make archival storage as cost-effective as possible \u2014 essentially becoming a commodity for developers building apps on top of Filecoin. This enables the information layer for humanity to be created and preserved. \n\nThe Shoah Foundation is an essential project that archives testimonials from genocide survivors. When it comes to large public datasets, the Internet Archive project stores websites and documents for public access using Filecoin. In addition, Zarr and GainForest store big public datasets with the goal of preventing natural catastrophes related to climate change. The Zarr project makes climate data available to researchers for analysis at scale. GainForest leverages satellite images to combat the effects of climate change.\n\nMetaverse and Gaming\n\nThere is a new generation of metaverse and gaming use cases leveraging Filecoin and IPFS. The underlying common aspect of these use cases is user monetization. In this sense, Blockbets and Gala Games support revenue generation and payouts for gamers. When it comes to artist monetization, Mona supports artists displaying their high-end creations in virtual spaces and selling them to collectors. Metaverse AI takes human interactions to the next level: it allows gamers to play and monetize their interactions with other AI-powered virtual humans inside the game.\n\nAudio and Video\n\nRecently, several audio and video applications leveraging Filecoin and IPFS have gained substantial traction. Take, for instance, the Web3 alternatives to Spotify or SoundCloud. Audius is a music streaming service that looks and feels like SoundCloud, but leverages IPFS. Currents.fm and Inflow Music support communities of music creators and curators. Huddle01 could be the next Zoom. It\u2019s a low-bandwidth video conferencing platform tailor-made for remote meetings, with a focus on NFT communities.\n\nRegular users may not be able to tell that Audius, Currents.fm, Inflow Music, or Huddle01 are decentralized or that they specifically leverage Filecoin and IPFS. Nonetheless, there is an ongoing shift towards <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/the-nft-effect-on-the-music-industry\">Web3 streaming applications</a> without users necessarily noticing it.\n\nAs the Filecoin ecosystem matures, more use cases are constantly being discovered. The development of the Filecoin Virtual Machine will unlock previously impossible use cases, creating a whole new class of use cases.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile decentralized storage is still in its early days, the Filecoin ecosystem has been thriving over the years. Filecoin and IPFS have been leveraged by a wide range of use cases, including NFTs, Web3, gaming, metaverse, and audio/video. Alongside Filecoin, alternatives like Arweave, Storj, and Sia could use the foundation of IPFS at scale. \n\nThe adoption of decentralized storage solutions and the integration of smart contracts built on top may open the door to novel applications. A significant milestone would be getting major browsers to adopt IPFS. Open data initiatives and decentralized compute may enable the next generation of applications beyond storage. \n\nThe main challenge for Filecoin is to prove its reliability as a storage provider and as an enabler of data-intensive Web3 services. Filecoin and IPFS operate at the cutting edge of the Web3 paradigm and offer an essential foundation for Web3 development. Their success depends on the Web3 applications building on those protocols.\n\nThis report was commissioned by Filecoin, a member of Protocol Services.

OSMO rewards are also issued via liquidity incentives for LPs\n\nIntroduction\n\nInvestors\u2019 belief in a multichain world as an answer to blockchain\u2019s scaling problems has drawn interest towards the Cosmos Network ecosystem, where an \u201cInternet of Blockchains\u201d exists to accommodate a universe of independent, sovereign app-chains. Each app-chain in the network functions as its unique Layer-1 blockchain designed to add to the functionality of the Cosmos Network.\n\nTo connect such an ecosystem of blockchains, a healthy financial exchange is necessary. Through these exchanges, capital allocators gain the liquidity to foster a healthy market, invest in growth projects, and drive investment to promising opportunities. The Cosmos Network supports its own native DEX, but it is the Osmosis Protocol that leads the pack in terms of liquidity, trading volume, and fees. In this report, we\u2019ll take a look at Osmosis and understand the features that make it stand out compared to other like-minded automated market makers (AMMs) in this multichain world.\n\nOverview of Osmosis\n\nBackground\n\nOsmosis is an Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC)-supported DEX in the Cosmos ecosystem. It was founded in January 2021 by Sunny Aggarwal, Josh Lee, and Dev Ojha, with the parent company Osmosis Labs being responsible for code development.\n\nThe co-founders each share experience working in the blockchain space. All three began at Tendermint, known for its byzantine-fault tolerance consensus engine. During that time, they worked on the underlying architecture of the Cosmos ecosystem and afterward split to work on various projects including the Keplr wallet. It was during this time they rejoined to start Osmosis, with the intention of building a fully-customizable DEX.\n\nHow Osmosis Works\n\nOn a functional level, Osmosis operates similarly to other AMMs. Liquidity pools lock tokens into a smart contract that self-executes trades via token swaps. Counterparties to traders come in the form of liquidity providers (LPs), who provide the underlying tokens, i.e., liquidity, to those pools. In return, those LPs receive designated LP tokens denoting their contribution to the pool, thereby measuring a share of the accrued fees generated. All traditional stuff.\n\nFurthermore, like many other AMMs, Osmosis relies on a deterministic pricing model to ensure the respective weights of tokens in each pool remain consistent. In fact, almost all AMMs use deterministic pricing because it helps determine the number of tokens in each trade. Although market pricing of any token may change, opportunities for arbitrageurs are minimized when the underlying pricing formula is maintained.\n\nLiquidity Incentives\n\nTo ensure abundant liquidity, the DEX institutes two mechanisms to help institute long-term viability: bonded liquidity gauges and exit fees.\n\nLongtime DeFi users may recognize the former as traditional liquidity incentives. The mechanism for bonded liquidity gauges is simple: LPs who add liquidity to a pool for a minimum period of time are rewarded with the native OSMO tokens.\n\nLPs can choose the period of time for which they willingly want to bond their tokens. The exact amount of OSMO rewards earned depends on the length of bonding time and the number of bonded tokens, all decided by protocol governance. Interestingly, not all pools receive rewards either; OSMO holders decide which pools earn liquidity incentives. Certain pools receive \u201callocation points,\u201d and subsequent OSMO rewards are issued proportionally based on each pool\u2019s points count.\n\nFortunately for the pools without internal incentives, OSMO tokens are not the only eligible rewards. External incentive providers, such as those traded within a pool, are able to distribute their own rewards. Just as with internal liquidity incentives, the external provider chooses which variables to set, such as the time needed for eligibility or the number of rewards.\n\nExit Fees\n\nIf bonded liquidity gauges are the carrot for long-term liquidity, exit fees are the stick. When LPs withdraw capital from liquidity pools, a small fee is charged in the form of LP tokens. This exit fee is determined by the pool creator and is designed to benefit the remaining contributors of the pool, seeing as the exit fee is burned. In total, when LPs decide to withdraw their liquidity, they get back their initial capital plus accrued transaction fees minus exit fees and impermanent loss.\n\nTraction\n\nNotably, Osmosis was the first IBC-enabled DEX in the Cosmos ecosystem. Although other DEXs such as Gravity DEX and Injective Protocol now exist, Osmosis was the first Cosmos-based app-chain to see a high volume of IBC transfers. Due to its first-mover advantage, Osmosis continues to rank first in IBC transactions and second in total transactions, behind the Terra ecosystem.\n\nOsmosis has benefited from the growing interest in the Cosmos ecosystem. Total trading volume and locked liquidity have both been on the rise since its launch. In fact, both metrics saw all-time highs within the last 30 days. And given past Osmosis activity or ownership of the OSMO token as a rumored qualifier for airdrops in the Cosmos ecosystem, there are no immediate signs of slowing down.\n\nProtocol Features\n\nLiquidity Pool Customization\n\nMuch of the inspiration behind Osmosis came from an Ethereum-based DEX, Balancer, and its ability to offer multi-asset liquidity pools. In the eyes of the Osmosis Labs team, blending assets into liquidity pools was the first of many customizable options. Through this level of customization, the role of the DEX evolved from only being able to trade spot-priced assets to be able to support an options market, interchain staking, and more.\n\nOsmosis pools offer flexible market-maker functions. Unlike Uniswap\u2019s constant product, Balancer\u2019s constant mean, and Curve\u2019s hybrid functions, Osmosis\u2019s functions are variable, thus realizing its goal of becoming an \u201cAMM laboratory.\u201d The DEX encourages liquidity providers to experiment with different market-making functions of their own choice. Osmosis spurs increased experimentation because new variations can ultimately lead to innovative solutions for reducing slippage or impermanent loss costs.\n\nPool parameters, including swap costs, initial token weights, and time-weighted average price calculations, are set by the pool\u2019s original creators. However, all Osmosis pools are self-governing by LP token holders. Voting power is distributed in accordance with fractional ownership of the capital in the pool. Longer capital commitments receive a boost in voting share. Since Osmosis expects the market to determine optimal capital efficiency, self-governing pools are merely another parameter to tweak to build the most competitive liquidity pool. The end game is a competitive market that provides greater skin-in-the-game for capital allocators.\n\nSuperfluid Staking\n\nCompared to a rollup-centric ecosystem like Ethereum\u2019s, multichain ecosystems like the Cosmos ecosystem face the challenge of bootstrapping their own security. Thus, for Zones in the Cosmos ecosystem, the issue of bootstrapping security becomes of utmost essence.\n\nOsmosis has designed a clever solution for this problem: superfluid staking. Considered one of the biggest advancements in proof-of-stake since liquid staking, this staking method allows LPs to provide liquidity with their native OSMO tokens while simultaneously using those same tokens to bring security to the underlying network. A visual representation of the Osmosis superfluid staking platform is below.\n\nThe superfluid staking model <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/the-superfluid-evolution-of-stake\">flips existing liquid staking solutions upside down</a>. Instead of providing liquidity to a bonded asset, superfluid staking takes bonded liquidity from an asset and stakes it to the network. The fact the asset is already bonded to local liquidity pools only helps simplify the network\u2019s balance between security and economic liquidity.\n\nWhitelisted liquidity pools are the only ones eligible to participate in superfluid staking. That\u2019s because Osmosis wants to limit the minting of risky assets by malicious actors who can then drain staked liquidity pools for the underlying OSMO token. Preventing this from happening is crucial for strong security, and the decision to determine whitelisted pools are eligible is left up to Osmosis governance.\n\nThe benefit of superfluid staking should be clear: it allows LPs to double their rewards through yields generated from trading fees and through staking rewards for securing the network. Meanwhile, the underlying network benefits from the extra security, leading to a win-win situation for all parties. Even more exciting, Osmosis doesn\u2019t have to be the only beneficiary. The protocol can offer staking-as-a-service to help other app-chains bootstrap their security too. The end result is a mesh network of intertwined security backed by this superfluid staking feature.\n\nCosmWasm Integration\n\nIn early March, Osmosis announced it had successfully worked with blockchain devtool company, Confio, to integrate the CosmWasm inter-blockchain smart contract engine into the Osmosis Protocol. By doing so, Osmosis can now access an untapped pool of resources because CosmWasm hosts one of the largest developer ecosystems outside of Ethereum and Solana.\n\nCosmWasm offers a WebAssembly virtual machine (Wasm) for developers familiar with Go and Rust. Developers receive a toolset to build new permissioned smart contracts which can run across multiple Cosmos SDK blockchains. Think of it as a framework intended to boost interoperable smart contract functionality between various Cosmos app-chains.\n\nThe announcement potentially hints at additional features coming to Osmosis, such as yield aggregators, liquidity management tools, and more. While this is exciting news for those looking to maximize yields, the Osmosis Labs team has made it clear its end goal is to remain an interoperable DEX-focused protocol \u2013 with additional bits and pieces from other contributors.\n\nMEV Resistance\n\nOsmosis\u2019s upcoming roadmap includes the tackling of maximum extractable value (MEV), one of the largest challenges seen in decentralized transactions. Since all trades are facilitated through the blockchain \u2013 meaning they\u2019re available on the public ledger \u2013 miners are able to rearrange transactions within their block to their own benefit. Miners would have an advantage over ordinary users in situations where it is important to get a transaction approved first, such as for front-running trades or acquiring a prized NFT. This type of MEV behavior disadvantages DEX users in favor of those with privileged access to the blockchain.\n\nMEV originated as a privacy issue only to evolve into a financial one. According to MEV Explore, over $600 million has been extracted away by miners since January 2020 on Ethereum alone.\n\nOsmosis\u2019s solution to MEV is to implement a form of encryption called threshold cryptography.\n\nThe process for threshold cryptography begins before transactions hit the mempool. Encrypted transactions hide transaction details from validators, preventing validators from figuring out which transactions to prioritize first. Only after the transactions are finalized and executed can validators see the details. Note that only the trade detail is encrypted during this process; the fee amount will continue to remain public. As a result, pending transactions continue to get added to the blockchain in order of fee amount.\n\nOSMO Tokeneconomics\n\nAs the native governance token, OSMO is behind all the features of the Osmosis app-chain. A maximum supply of 100 million tokens will be set in circulation daily epoch-based issuances. The emissions schedule is similar to Bitcoin\u2019s famous \u201chalvening,\u201d except Osmosis will follow a \u201cthirdening\u201d schedule, reducing the number of new tokens by a third every year. The tokens applicable for issuance will be split among staking rewards, developer vesting, community pool allocations, and liquidity mining incentives. The full supply curve schedule can be found below.\n\nThe OSMO token launch was a fair launch distributed across airdrop recipients and the protocol\u2019s strategic reserve. Notably, 50% of the supply was airdropped to ATOM holders, and the remaining 50% was set aside for a strategic reserve, which will support the ongoing development of the protocol. The reserve tokens could be used to fund open-source projects, make investments, or provide grants.\n\nConclusion\n\nCompetition for transaction volume is fierce. At the end of the day, successful applications must continuously innovate to keep attracting liquidity providers. The Osmosis community believes the exchange has a strong chance to corner the market. With its position as a multichain centerpiece, status as a host to flexible pool parameters, reputation as a staking innovator, and exciting MEV-resistant roadmap, Osmosis is prepared to capture a significant amount of liquidity and protocol revenue.

Networks like Terra, BNB Chain, Fantom, and Avalanche witnessed unprecedented growth in average daily network transactions, active daily addresses, market capitalization, and total value locked (TVL). Much of the growth can be attributed to the competitive forces shaping traditional industry strategies that resemble Michael Porter's Competitive Strategies. Congestion on the Ethereum network, the slow rollout of Layer-2 scaling solutions, the ability to bridge assets cross-chain, and the ability to execute smart contracts on more efficient networks allowed new alternatives to gain a competitive position as differentiated solutions and cost leaders.\n\nWhile Layer-1 platforms exhibit many fundamental differences, almost all of them aim to solve the blockchain trilemma by attaining adequate decentralization, scalability, and security while hosting smart contracts. While their smart contracts inherit blockchain's data availability and security, they also inherit its lack of confidentiality. With that in mind, the top Layer-1s do not currently support privacy on their public networks as all records are logged on the blockchain, allowing anyone to read their contents. This presents privacy concerns, due to the possibility of linking ledger addresses to real identities. As adoption grows, users may start to prefer privacy surrounding their activity or sensitive data. This lack of confidentiality, in a sense, could potentially be considered a fourth problem for Layer-1 platforms to solve, and perhaps a \"quadrilemma\" is on the verge of sparking the next leg of the race towards adoption.\n\nAs adoption continues, new platforms with privacy solutions may start to experience the exponential growth realized in the recent past. One such platform, the Oasis Network, is a Layer-1 that aims to solve the trilemma and do so with the flexibility to host privacy-enabled smart contracts. With its unique architecture and deployment of confidential computing technology, the Oasis Network is planting the seeds for growing an open, data-responsible economy with privacy.\n\nBackground\n\nThe Oasis team was formed in 2018 and consists of contributors from around the globe with diverse backgrounds ranging from start-ups to traditional finance and tech companies. The team also has strong roots in academia. Dawn Song, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, known for her research in computer security and artificial intelligence, is the Founder of Oasis Labs. Oasis Labs is an active member of the Oasis Ecosystem, and one of the early contributors to the Oasis technology. The team raised funds from well-known venture capital firms and investors such as Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), Polychain Capital, Pantera, and Binance Labs, among others, to support the network\u2019s initial development. After the private testnet launch in 2018, the public testnet underwent various iterations alongside bug bounties, audits, and network upgrades before the public mainnet launch in 2020. Fast forward to today, and it has since gone through additional technical developments and an ecosystem expansion that includes a $200 million ecosystem fund while becoming the second-most <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/messari-fund-analysis-q4-21-examining-liquid-portfolios-of-crypto-funds?utmsource=newslettertop&utmmedium=organicemail&utmcampaign=fundanalysisq421\">commonly held</a> asset by crypto funds as of Q4 2021.\n\nSource: Oasis\n\nAt the onset, the Oasis Network was designed to be a privacy-focused, scalable, Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible Proof-of-Stake (PoS) smart contract platform. Its privacy and scalability features are designed to advance DeFi and Web3 by creating a new type of digital asset called Tokenized Data. Unlike existing tokenized data solutions at the application layer, the Oasis Tokenized Data solution is at the network layer, allowing applications to build on top of and harness the benefits of its confidential compute technology. Collectively, the design is intended to allow users to take control of and monetize the private data they generate, thereby incentivizing what Oasis calls a data-responsible economy.\n\nNetwork Architecture\n\nThe Oasis Network utilizes a modular architecture that separates consensus and smart contract execution into the Consensus Layer and the ParaTime Layer, respectively. Both layers are integrated to provide the same functionality of a single network. However, separating these layers allows ParaTimes to process transactions of different complexity in parallel with shared consensus. With this flexibility, workloads and upgrades processed on one ParaTime will work symphonically with consensus to independently ensure network security and finality without impacting other ParaTimes.\n\nSource: Oasis\n\nThe Consensus Layer\n\nThe Consensus Layer accepts updated state hashes from ParaTimes and writes them into the next block of the Oasis blockchain, while ParaTimes operate as separate networks that can be configured and customized to run specific applications. The network's two-layer modular solution addresses both security and scalability. While the flexibility to develop ParaTimes in isolation supports scalability, it also enables specific execution solutions such as confidential computation technology to address smart contract privacy concerns.\n\nSource: Oasis\n\nThe Consensus Layer is the foundation of the Oasis Network and, in and of itself, is designed around the principles of modularity, which allows for agnostic consensus such that it can be interchangeable with any consensus logic in the future. Currently, the base layer consists of a modified version of Tendermint Core, a Byzantine-Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus engine. It uses a PoS mechanism and a decentralized set of validator nodes and node operators. The validator nodes are randomly selected to form a committee that accepts state hashes from ParaTimes, maintains the public ledger, and ultimately secures the network. The committee's size dictates the security of the Oasis blockchain and is currently set to 110 validator nodes. Further, unlike most consensus layers, node operators run distinctive types of nodes that are tasked with providing a minimal set of services (e.g., staking and registry) specifically for ParaTime functionality.\n\nThe Consensus Layer Beyond Tendermint Core\n\nAs the Consensus Layer diagram above illustrates, the multiple layers of consensus begin at the top, with the nodes tasked with providing a minimal set of services. These services range from maintaining epoch-based time-keeping services to coordinating key manager runtimes and storing and publishing policy documents and status updates required for key manager replication. This multi-node architecture aims to reduce complexity and, ultimately, the risk of computational errors at the execution layer.\n\nFurther, Tendermint Core consumes consensus logic via the Application Blockchain Interface (ABCI), the interface between Tendermint and a single application. Since the Oasis Network has multiple services that need to be provided by the Consensus Layer, it uses an ABCI application multiplexer which performs some common functions and dispatches transactions to the appropriate service-specific nodes. This is how core consensus is able to interact with each of the service nodes.\n\nCore Layer Staking and Consensus Voting Power\n\nThe current voting power mechanism is stake-weighted, which means the consensus voting power is proportional to its stake. In this model, the network will require signatures by validators representing greater than two-thirds of the total stake of the committee to sign a block. Note that in Tendermint, a validator's opportunities to propose a block in the randomly generated block proposer order are also proportional to its voting power.\n\nValidators must stake a minimum of 100 tokens to contribute to the network's security. Each registered entity can have at most one node elected to the consensus committee at a time. The chance of being selected for the committee will be proportional to a validator's stake weight (self-stake amount plus delegated stake).\n\nThe network currently targets an inflation rate between 2% and 12%, with validator reward amounts dependent on the length of time staked. To be eligible for staking rewards in a given epoch, a node needs to sign at least 75% of blocks in that epoch.\n\nThe network will only slash for double-signing. Double-signing penalties will result in the loss of the minimum stake amount and a frozen node. Freezing the node is a precaution to prevent the node from being over-penalized. The network will not slash for liveness or uptime. Oasis requires a 14-day unbonding period if validators or delegators move their staked funds. During this time, staked tokens are still at risk of getting slashed for double-signing and do not accrue rewards.\n\nThe ParaTime Layer\n\nThe ParaTime Layer is the smart contract execution layer that consists of multiple, parallel ParaTimes, each representing a computing environment with a shared state. Operating a ParaTime requires the participation of node operators, who contribute nodes to an open or closed compute committee in exchange for rewards. Oasis uses discrepancy detection to verify ParaTime execution. This verifiable computing technique permits the use of smaller committees and requires a smaller replication factor for the same level of security, which, according to Oasis, is more efficient than sharding or parachain models. The two key features include (1) random selection of compute nodes from a population to form a compute committee and (2) only accepting the results if all committee members agree. If there is a discrepancy, a separate protocol called \"discrepancy resolution\" is enabled, serving as another security parameter. In a sense, smart contract execution functions similarly to the Consensus Layer and its use of node operators and a compute committee. ParaTimes can be operated by anyone and can have their own reward system, participation requirements, and structure; meanwhile, node operators can participate in any number of ParaTimes.\n\nSource: Oasis\n\nAs described previously, the separation from consensus allows the network to address scalability through its modular design. The separation also allows ParaTimes to be different from each other. One difference is the ability to run confidential ParaTimes or non-confidential ParaTimes, with the latter being similar to Ethereum and other alternative Layer-1 networks. Furthermore, ParaTimes can evolve independently while maintaining consensus even as security, scalability, or privacy technologies advance. In other words, the network can maintain a public ledger while having an ecosystem of separate ParaTimes that can evolve with technological advancements, allowing it to adapt and serve future use cases. Beyond confidentiality, Paratimes have the flexibility to configure parameters such as the size of the committee's performing execution, which relates to the level of security a user needs to satisfy particular business requirements. Further, ParaTimes can run different VMs such as EVM or Rust-based smart contracts and can be designed to be permissioned or permissionless systems. Ultimately, ParaTime customization and flexibility allow developers to strike the desired balance between security, performance, and privacy.\n\nConfidential ParaTimes\n\nPrivacy-enabled smart contract execution is one of the core value propositions that Oasis is known for. Cipher, an upcoming ParaTime, will support confidential smart contracts. In a confidential ParaTime, nodes are required to use a secure computing technology called a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE). TEEs are analogous to a black box for smart contract execution. With the use of key management (illustrated in the ParaTime Layer diagram above), encrypted data goes into the black box (i.e., Secure Enclave) along with the smart contract, where the data is decrypted, processed by the smart contract, and then encrypted before it is sent out of the black box. This process ensures that data remains confidential and is not disclosed to the node operator or application developer. Other secure compute technology, such as Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs), can also be used to execute private smart contracts. The interchangeability of secure compute technology is an additional example of modularity and value proposition at the ParaTime Layer.\n\nSource: Oasis\n\nThe ROSE Token\n\nThe ROSE token is the Oasis Network's native token used for transaction fees, staking, and delegation on the Consensus Layer and for smart contract operations that require fees on the ParaTime Layer. The token is also anticipated to be used for network governance, which is currently being modeled to be a hybrid off- and on-chain mechanism whereby changes to the network will be determined democratically by node operators. Voting power is anticipated to be based proportionally on self and delegated stake.\n\nSuppose the network's value proposition of privacy allows for continued traction. In that case, the token will likely accrue value from increased protocol revenue, the expansion of network infrastructure and node operator stake, and demand for governance stake. The token itself has a fixed supply of 10 billion ROSE. Not all tokens were released publicly on mainnet launch. Due to release schedules and locks, only a fraction (1.5 billion ROSE) of the total existing token supply was introduced into circulation at mainnet launch.\n\nAs a percentage of the total existing token supply, the quantity of ROSE tokens reserved for various network functions follows the allocation below.\n\nBackers: Between 2018 and 2020 Oasis raised over $45 million from well-known investment funds that acquired 23% of the total supply cap at network launch.\n\nSource: Oasis\n\nCore Contributors: As compensation to core contributors for contributing to the development of the Oasis Network, 20% of the total supply cap was allocated at network launch.\n\nFoundation Endowment: With the initial 10% allocation of the total supply cap, the endowment to the Oasis Foundation is tasked with developing and maintaining the Oasis Network. A portion of the Foundation tokens not introduced to the circulating supply at launch are staked on the network. Foundation staking rewards go back into the network via validator delegations, network feature development, and ecosystem grants.\n\nCommunity and Ecosystem: Funding programs and services that engage the Oasis Network community, including developer grants and other community incentives by the Oasis Foundation, initially held 18.5% of the total supply cap.\n\nStrategic Partners and Reserve: Funding programs and services provided by key strategic partners in the Oasis Network initially held 5% of the total supply cap.\n\nStaking Rewards: On-chain rewards are set to be paid out to stakers and delegators for contributing to the security of the Oasis Network. Approximately 2.35 billion ROSE (23.5% of the supply cap) will be paid out as staking rewards to stakers and delegators over four years. Rewards will be disbursed by on-chain mining mechanisms, calculated based on how many blocks are produced, how many nodes are participating in staking, and how many tokens are staked.\n\nSource: Oasis\n\nThe tokens not allocated for staking will be disbursed according to the following 10-year release schedule:\n\nSource: Oasis\n\n  \nThe token supply curve above begins at launch, which occurred in 2020. A rapid increase of unlocked tokens began after 12 months and began to level off recently in the 15th month. In 2024, the token supply release will experience a further leveling until hitting its plateau in the 10th year.\n\nCurrent State and Glimpse into the Oasis Network Ecosystem\n\nLike many digital assets, the ROSE token has declined in valuation by ~50% year to date (YTD), along with a decline in trading volume across exchanges. The top three trading pairs by volume are trading on Binance (USDT, BUSD, BTC) currently making up ~45% of all ROSE trading volume.\n\nWhile trading volume has declined, liquidity of the ROSE token is still relatively healthy, with daily trading volume ranging between $100 million to $500 million, equating to ~$125 million in trading volume on average YTD. Though valuation and trading volume metrics have experienced a downward trend, network usage has experienced a noticeable upward trend.\n\nAt the beginning of 2022, the Consensus Layer of the network was averaging below 10,000 transactions per day. By the middle of January, transactions grew to greater than 140,000, representing an approximate 2,600% increase. Current daily transactions of 110,000 are outpacing the YTD average of 100,000, which also indicates an upward trend. As of March 15, 2022, consensus consists of 153,000 active addresses and has processed 7 million transactions in the aggregate. Further, Emerald launched this year and has generated as many as 3.8 million transactions in a single day and is averaging about 650,000 transactions per day.\n\nBeyond market data and network usage, the network infrastructure has grown from 100 active validators to 110 and has witnessed evolving decentralization metrics.\n\nCurrently, seven validators contribute to just under ~33% of the network's total stake. The methodology behind the Nakamoto Coefficient assumes 33% is the threshold of total stake needed to compromise a network. The higher the coefficient, the more secure a network is deemed to be as it would require a greater number of validators to collude against the network. Given this methodology, the Nakamoto Coefficient of Oasis is similar to other Layer-1 networks, even though most others launched before Oasis, allowing for more time to decentralize their networks. Only time and adoption will determine the extent Oasis Network grows validator sets and a more diversified distribution of stake.\n\nEcosystem Overview\n\nThere may be a reason why the Oasis Network's token symbol is ROSE.\n\nSource: Oasis\n\nAn oasis is a fertile place in an arid environment. The water it provides turns into a thriving ecosystem of plants and animals. In the same way, the Oasis Network provides the resources for applications to build DeFi services and new use cases. Evaluating Oasis Network's current state is a starting point for assessing the ecosystem. Given recent developments and anticipated value propositions to come, following along to see whether it succeeds at thriving will be top of mind as we look ahead into 2022.\n\nA key driver of recent growth was the result of launching the Emerald ParaTime. Emerald is the EVM-compatible system essential for Solidity-based smart contract execution. Having EVM compatibility and Solidity support means that any token developed for Ethereum can be migrated through existing bridge infrastructures like Wormhole, cBridge, and Multichain, which also went live earlier this year. Emerald also allows the ERC-20 token standard to run natively on the Oasis Network. Ultimately, the launch of Emerald brought a flurry of DeFi activity to the network, which is reflected in the increase of daily transactions at the beginning of 2022.\n\nDeFi on the Oasis Network\n\nSource: Oasis\n\nAlong with Emerald, the network launched DeFi infrastructure including the Oasis Wallet for the ROSE token, and it also integrated with bridges like Multichain. This sparked the network's first DeFi application, YuzuSwap (YUZU). YuzuSwap is the network\u2019s first community-developed decentralized exchange (DEX) that offers users low-cost trading services. The DEX allocates 20% of all transaction fees to the YUZU DAO where holders of the YUZU token can use those funds to incentivize further protocol growth. Within a month of launch, YuzuSwap exceeded $100 million in TVL and $1 billion in trading volume.\n\nAnother major contributor to recent growth is ValleySwap (VS), a DEX that launched as recently as February 24, 2022. The launch of ValleySwap clearly generated a renewed uptrend in network activity at the end of February as daily transactions spiked at that time. As of March 15, YuzuSwap and ValleySwap are producing ~$1\u20133 million in daily trading volume and have accrued $37 million and $125 million in TVL, respectively.\n\nThe third-largest\u00a0DeFi application on Oasis is Fountain Protocol (FTP), the network\u2019s first lending protocol. It launched with 200,000 FTP in incentives and generated over $7 million in TVL in its first day. Using Fountain, users can experience one-stop management of DeFi assets with high capital efficiency and take advantage of the low-cost Oasis Network. As of March 15, Fountain Protocol is the third-largest DeFi application on the Oasis Network after growing to $17 million in TVL.\n\nWith the launch of these DeFi protocols, the Oasis Network not only saw an increase in daily transactions but rapid growth in TVL.\n\nIntuitively, the market cap to TVL ratio declined as the market cap declined by 50%, and TVL increased by 190%. This fundamental ratio represents how a network is valued relative to value locked. If the ratio is a large number, the network value is viewed as being overvalued. In other words, a network with an MCap/TVL below 1 represents a network value that is less than the capital locked in the entire network. Given that the network was carrying a nearly $1 billion market valuation before the launch of DeFi, it makes sense to see such a drastic decline in the ratio after the resulting growth of TVL.\n\nThe Ecosystem Beyond Emerald\n\nOasis Network is launching two additional ParaTimes that go beyond Emerald. The Parcel ParaTime and the Cipher ParaTime. Parcel is the system that stores, governs, and computes confidential data. By integrating Parcel SDK into their applications, developers can incorporate privacy-preserving data storage, governance, and computation. This ultimately serves as the Tokenized Data engine, which can convert any data file into an NFT.\n\nWith Parcel, the Oasis Network intends to foster a responsible data society using Tokenized Data. Data providers on the Oasis Network will be able to put their Tokenized Data to use by earning rewards from applications that analyze or control how their sensitive information is used on different services. This concept differs from the data ownership we are familiar with today in that data is not monetized or controlled by those who generate it.\n\nSource: Oasis\n\nCurrently, Parcel is a permissioned ParaTime for use by enterprise partners such as Binance, Genetica, and BMW. Binance is one such partner that has engaged with Oasis to combat bad actors across various exchanges. With theft and attacks as prevalent events in crypto, exchanges need a platform to identify and ban bad actors. Oasis and Binance created the CryptoSafe Platform to enable exchanges to share threat intelligence data. Using the network's confidential compute feature, exchange data can be kept confidential even when compared across exchanges. While Parcel is currently a permissioned network, it is anticipated that it will become permissionless by the end of 2022, bringing Tokenized Data into public reality.\n\nFurther, the third piece of the puzzle is the Cipher ParaTime. Cipher is the confidential smart contract system set to launch at the end of Q2 2022. Cipher is a core value proposition of Oasis that will support WebAssembly smart contracts that make confidential compute possible.\n\nWhen the additional ParaTimes launch, they have the potential to open the network to an ecosystem aimed at privacy-first DeFi, including privacy-preserving decentralized exchanges. To that end, they are designed to make it easier for DEXs to prevent front-running transactions, for NFT users to protect their assets privately, and for them to hypothetically unlock more value from traditional credit and lending markets seeking confidentiality. An example of how DeFi applications can unlock the value of Parcel and Cipher is depicted below.\n\nSource: Oasis\n\nIn this example, users will be able to utilize Cipher and a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) to protect their private data while monetizing and disclosing private data to various DeFi services through the power of Parcel.\u00a0 For example, a user's risk profile and reputation could be used such that lending services can manage risk and gauge appropriate collateralization requirements. With this knowledge, lending services like Aave could offer under-collateralized lending based on credit-worthy reputations. It will be interesting to track their adoption and usage as the market opportunity for these ParaTimes is substantial. Additional use of these ParaTimes may also generate or supersede the network activity as their Emerald counterpart did in early January.\n\nCompetitive Landscape\n\nCompared to the top five protocols by TVL, Oasis metrics may not be as large but represent the market opportunity the network has when compared to other Layer-1 platforms. There are a few other key items to point out. First, Oasis launched its Consensus Layer later than most of the top L1s in existence today. It also didn't launch its EVM ParaTime until January of this year. Lastly, none of them have confidential compute technology at the center of their ecosystems. Nonetheless, when we evaluate each network over the same period, Oasis experienced greater growth in TVL than each of the top chains. As of March 15, 2022, Ethereum experienced a 23% decline in TVL while Oasis experienced a 192% increase. Although this very well could be the result of the high growth that is usually experienced by any early-stage endeavor, the traction may suggest there is a driver for using and building on the Oasis Network technology.\n\nThe key to Oasis closing the gap on its multibillion dollar counterparts may rely on the privacy value proposition on the way. If adoption becomes apparent and the gap closes by even a small percentage, Oasis is poised to capture market position as a privacy-enabled, smart contract platform.\n\nThe Road Ahead, Potential Challenges, and Growth Strategy\n\nLike many networks in this highly competitive space, positioning in the market may come with some challenges. The growth of the network infrastructure for additional ParaTimes needs to continue for a successful launch. As with the launch of any network, some potential risks and setbacks could occur due to a lack of infrastructure and decentralization. Given the recently generated network activity from the launch of DeFi, Oasis needs to find strategies to successfully launch additional ParaTimes, maintain growth, and pursue opportunities to close the gap with more mature networks. With that in mind, Oasis does appear to have a strategy to mitigate these challenges. In addition to the anticipated launch of Cipher and Parcel, the Oasis Foundation has engaged with a group of backers that include Binance Labs, Pantera, Dragonfly Capital, and others to pool together more than $200 million in funding for developers and projects looking to build on the Oasis Network. Moving forward, it will be imperative to evaluate the continued growth of Emerald and the launch of Cipher and Parcel in tandem with the capital efficiency of the ecosystem fund.\n\nIn addition to the ecosystem fund, the Oasis Foundation has been working with development teams through Grant and DevAccelerator programs to build applications and integrations on top of the Oasis Network. As a result of these programs, there are over a dozen recipients actively building.\n\nFinally, the Oasis Network has implemented a strategy to build community by way of an Ambassador Program and University Program. Oasis seeks to build a global body of ambassadors to run meetups, answer developer questions, and stress test the Oasis Network. The University Program stretches across five continents, with over 25 university departments and blockchain clubs participating. University Program members run nodes and build apps that include Blockchain at Berkeley, Tsinghua University's Student Association of Digital Finance, and Cambridge University's Blockchain Society.\n\nCollectively, Oasis has organized an ecosystem fund, grant, accelerator program, and community programs to mitigate network risk by expanding network infrastructure and driving network activity for the foreseeable future.\n\nClosing Summary\n\nThe Layer-1 smart contract platform race for adoption and market share is likely far from over as Ethereum continues its architectural redesign and incorporates scaling solutions. New use cases continue to demand alternative solutions, and one of those solutions may very well address the desire for confidential computation technology on a purpose-built, modular execution layer. With its unique architecture and deployment of confidential computing technology, the Oasis Network seeks to meet such a demand. Oasis stands well-positioned to close the gap in the Layer-1 race as the network moves forward with expanding applications on Emerald and launching Cipher and Parcel.\n\nThough technical challenges may present themselves along the way, Oasis is positioned with a growth strategy that includes an ecosystem fund, incentive programs, and community initiatives organized to mitigate such challenges and drive growth. Although many Layer-1s experienced exponential growth in 2021, Oasis was not quite in the race as major developments and launches had yet to occur. To that end, this year is a pivotal year for the Oasis Network, as the network unleashes its value proposition to the decentralized world.\n\nThis report was commissioned by Oasis, a member of Protocol Services.

With cloud providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure accounting for over 60% of the cloud computing market, most of the internet\u2019s data lives on centralized networks at the behest of only three owners.\n\nAkash Network gives consumers an alternative to centralized cloud providers in its Akash Deployment Marketplace that allows users to set a price they are willing to pay to deploy their software while providers with extra compute power bid to host the user\u2019s application. This marketplace for underutilized computing resources functions very similarly to Airbnb, allowing providers to rent out unused capacity.\n\nOn the Importance of Cloud Computing\n\nNo one is shielded from the omnipresent cloud. Whether it's your phone, car, streaming service, or social media accounts, you utilize cloud technology every day. In its simplest form, cloud computing allows you to access services on the internet instead of on your machine.\n\nIn the archaic days of DVD players, the only legal way to watch Disney movies was by physically purchasing the DVD and inserting it into the player connected to the television. Watching many movies required purchasing a collection of these discs. The cloud changed the mechanics of this physical interaction while keeping the same product, films. By storing the archived film data and running backend processes of the Disney Plus streaming service on remote servers, Disney eliminated the requirement for users to have product-specific hardware (DVD players) so it could deliver the same product through the internet.\n\nDisney doesn\u2019t just use the cloud to host customer-facing applications like its streaming service. For the operational side of its business, Disney and many other companies use cloud technology for data protection, data analytics, storage backup, server virtualization (virtual machines), and software development. But companies like Disney don\u2019t need to own the server infrastructure that facilitates all of these necessary operations. Instead, most companies outsource server management to cloud service providers.\n\nBefore the prevalence of Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure, companies had their own onsite data centers. From hiring IT teams that manage hardware updates and maintenance to purchasing large plots of real estate and paying colossal energy bills, costs related to IT infrastructure would be recorded as capital expenditures. However, paying for cloud computing where the cloud provider absorbs all of the costs associated with IT infrastructure is considered an operational expense, which is tax-advantaged. Although deploying applications to a big three cloud provider comes with monetary benefits and improved operational efficiencies, cloud consumers are locked into vendors and have limited control over their deployments in a centralized cloud environment.\n\nAs more enterprises understand the higher levels of scalability, flexibility, and cost-savings they can achieve by outsourcing IT infrastructure to cloud service providers, Gartner predicts that in 2022 end-users will spend $482 billion on cloud services. This is up 54% from the $313 billion spent in 2020. The pandemic\u2019s push for remote-hybrid work is only helping to accelerate the growth of the cloud computing industry. According to Flexera, 92% of U.S. companies already utilize cloud technology, with 90% claiming usage is higher than initially planned due to the pandemic. This is in stark contrast to Europe, where only 42% of enterprises were on the cloud in 2021, up from 19% in 2016.\n\nDespite the rapid growth and prevalence of cloud computing, 30% of server capacity sits idle in many data centers. As the market for cloud computing continues to grow globally, a convergence will emerge among providers seeking to rectify supply-side inefficiencies and enterprises looking for the flexibility to scale their business, outsource IT infrastructure, and avoid the complications caused by centralized entities.\n\nThe Akash Marketplace\n\nAkash is an open-source platform with a distributed peer-to-peer cloud marketplace that connects users seeking cloud services to infrastructure providers with excess computing resources. Its platform is used for hosting and managing deployments and contains cloud management services that leverage Kubernetes to run workloads.\n\nThese users, called tenants, are typically developers seeking to deploy Docker containers to cloud providers that meet specific criteria. A Docker container essentially contains packaged code, its dependencies, and ensures the corresponding application runs the same on any computing environment. For example, even if the configurations of an application differ when it is developed on a laptop, tested in a sandbox, and sent to the cloud to run, containers can support all three environments without requiring changes to the code.\n\nThe Akash marketplace functions through a reverse auction model, giving users the ability to name a price and describe the resources they want for deployed containers. When a cloud provider, which can range from an individual to a data center, underutilizes computing resources, it rents those resources out by bidding to host deployments, in the same way Airbnb hosts can rent out their extra space. Deploying containers on Akash costs roughly 10 times less than any of the big three cloud service providers (Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure).\n\nAll records of requests, bids, leases, and settlement payments are stored on-chain using the Akash Token (AKT).\n\nLeadership\n\nGreg Osuri, co-founder and CEO: With a cloud architecture and entrepreneurial background that dates back to 2008, Osuri founded Akash as a decentralized alternative to the traditional cloud computing industry. Before Akash, Osuri founded four other companies and worked at distinguished firms, including Miracle Software Systems as a technical architect, IBM as a critical infrastructure consultant, and Kaiser Permanente as a cloud infrastructure consultant. Osuri\u2019s notable founding projects include AngelHack, one of the most diverse developer ecosystems in the world with over 175,000 developers in 50 cities, and Overclock Labs, Akash\u2019s core contributor focused on making a decentralized and open internet.\n\nAdam Bozanich, co-founder and CTO: Bozanich is a veteran in the software engineering space and has held senior-level roles since 2006. With experience across software development domains, Bozanich worked in QA automation at Symantec, security engineering at Mu Dynamics, and server engineering at Topspin Media. He also co-founded two other companies before Akash: Sprouts Tech and Overclock Labs with Osuri.\n\nWho Runs the Network, Overclock or Akash?\n\nOverclock Labs essentially bootstrapped the Akash Network under the direction of Osuri and Bozanich. Since then, Akash has become a decentralized protocol. Although Overlock is still involved in Akash\u2019s development, it does not control the majority of the 100 validators on the network and, hence, cannot manipulate AKT transactions. Despite its lack of control, Overclock is still Akash\u2019s principal contributor to its open-source codebase, though many contributors come from outside of Overclock.\n\nSince 2020, Akash Network\u2019s GitHub has seen a rise in the commits of contributors not affiliated with Overlock Labs. A commit is an addition or change to the code of any length. Because commits vary in complexity and utility, they can be used as an indicator for developer activity within a given project. Although Overclock continues to account for the majority of Akash\u2019s development, Akash\u2019s own developer community is growing and contributing to the development of the project at an increasing rate.\n\nThe Akash Network\n\nThe Akash Network built its blockchain on a Cosmos SDK framework utilizing the Tendermint Byzantine-Fault Tolerant (BFT) engine for its Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) consensus algorithm. To simplify the seven or eight buzzwords used in the previous sentence, at its core, Akash uses the Tendermint engine as the security and networking layer of its blockchain. And it uses the Cosmos SDK to customize various aspects of its blockchain, from governance to staking.\n\nStaking AKT in a DPoS Protocol\n\nBecause Akash uses a DPoS consensus algorithm, staking responsibilities vary between delegators and validators. Validators operate nodes to secure on-chain AKT network transactions. Although anyone can become a validator, only those with the computing resources and technical expertise to run an Akash node will.\n\nThe minimum system requirements that Akash recommends to operate validator nodes include a 4-core CPU, 16GB of RAM (memory), 256GB of SSD (storage), and a Linux Ubuntu OS. Of course, better specifications will equal better performance; regardless, these are relatively modest minimum requirements compared to a blockchain like Solana. On Solana, validators need a 12-core/24-thread CPU, 128GB of RAM at a minimum (256GB RAM suggested), and three separate storage units (recommended) totaling 2 TB (500 GB for accounts, 1 TB for ledger, 500 GB for OS).\n\nThe frequency with which the consensus algorithm chooses validators to approve network transactions \u2014 and hence, receive inflationary rewards \u2014 is in proportion to the amount of AKT the validator stakes. This creates a competitive environment among validators to acquire AKT themselves or from delegators.\n\nDelegators delegate their right to earn validation rewards on AKT to a validator who does the work of running a node. This validator then splits the rewards with the delegator (in proportion to how much they delegated) and takes a commission fee off the top. AKT holders can delegate through the Keplr desktop wallet.\n\nAKT Tokeneconomics & Utility\n\nAt genesis, 100 million AKT were distributed to the allocations found in the graphic above, while roughly 289 million AKT were scheduled to be released as inflationary emissions to stakers initially set to a 100% APR meant to halve every two years. Governance voting changed halving to roughly every 3.7 months. According to Akash founder Greg Osuri, the protocol has plans to reward cloud providers with emissions, though the functionality will be implemented at a later date.\n\nThe vesting schedules are described below based on the initial allocations of the 100 million AKT at genesis (September 2020):\n\nInvestors (34.5% or 34.5 million AKT): roughly 17.3 million AKT released after a one-year lock-up, following a graded vesting schedule unlocking roughly 8.6 million AKT after every six months\nTeam & Advisors (27% or 27 million AKT): 11 million AKT released after a one-year lock-up, following a graded vesting schedule unlocking six million AKT after every six months\nDecentralized Cloud Foundation (19.7% or 19.7 million AKT): one million AKT unlocked at TGE following a graded vesting schedule unlocking roughly 8.9 million AKT after the first month, then roughly 4.1 million AKT after the next six months, then roughly 2.1 million AKT after the following 11 months and after two more six-month periods\nEcosystem (8% or 8 million AKT): 2 million AKT released after a one-month lock-up, following a graded vesting schedule unlocking 1.5 million AKT after the first six months, then after the following 11 months, and then after two more six-month periods\nTestnets (5% or 5 million AKT): 800,000 AKT released after a one-month lock-up, following a graded vesting schedule unlocking 1.05 million AKT after the first six months, then after the following 11 months, and then after two more six-month periods\nVendors & Marketing (4% or 4 million AKT): 800,000 AKT released after a one-month lock-up, following a graded vesting schedule unlocking 800,000 AKT after the first six months, then after the following 11 months, and then after two more six-month periods\nPublic Sale (1.8% or 1.8 million AKT): No vesting schedule\n\nAKT is a utility token with multiple uses in the protocol encompassing security, rewards, network governance, and transactions.\n\nNode operators that validate transactions on the mainnet and receive rewards must have a total stake of AKT that positions them as a top 100 holder among peers. This total stake comes from the amount the validator allocates themself combined with the amount delegated to them. Validators on Akash are not required to stake a minimum amount of their own AKT holdings. Accounting for more AKT increases the odds a node operator will get chosen to validate transactions, thereby increasing the frequency of their rewards. To dissuade malicious/lazy validators, those who do not adhere to the consensus guidelines risk getting a portion of their stake slashed.\n\nNot yet implemented but mentioned in the whitepaper, Akash plans to charge a \u201ctake fee\u201d for every successful lease. It would then send the fee to the Take Income Pool to be distributed to holders. The take fee is planned to be 10% for AKT transactions and 20% for when other cryptocurrencies are used. Akash also plans to reward holders for the time lock-up of their AKT holdings. Holders who stake for longer periods of time will be eligible for larger rewards.\n\nOnly AKT holders can participate in governance. This includes submitting proposals and voting on them. The cost of submitting a proposal is a non-refundable deposit of 1,000 AKT. For passed proposals that require binary updates(code changes), validators must update the codebase to avoid penalties and continue validating the network.\n\nAKT is the ecosystem\u2019s reserve currency, used for gas fees and as the default medium of exchange in transactions between providers and tenants. The Akash whitepaper describes a settlement option to lock in an exchange rate between AKT and a settlement currency that is meant to counter AKT price volatility in marketplace transactions. This settlement option has yet to be implemented.\n\nAkash\u2019s Continued Development\n\nAkash learned not to develop too far into the future after postponing the development and release of supermini, the home-based miniature supercomputer that would have seamlessly integrated with the Akash Network allowing people to use it for heavy workloads or to rent it out.\n\nWith 33 cloud providers supporting 525 active leases at about a 90% discount to traditional cloud computing market prices (due to supply being much higher than demand), Akash is working on ways to unlock market expansion. It plans to improve both its blockchain and cloud marketplace. Developing on both fronts will make Akash\u2019s products more palatable to traditional cloud computing consumers and open the protocol up to wider crypto adoption.\n\nThe release of Akash\u2019s Testnet 3 on March 7, 2022, shows that the team is focused on developing new features for the mainnet including:\n\nPersistent storage: Workloads containing large data sets such as blockchain nodes will be able to persist data between restarts. If deployment drops or re-initializes, data will not be lost.\nFractional uAKT: Removes the implicit minimum cost of deployment (one uAKT per block). Fractional uAKT will keep prices more consistent and resource consumption more accurate to the cost.\nAuthZ: Users can authorize a wallet to spend a set number of tokens by another source wallet exclusively on deployments. This reduces security concerns when big teams work together on deployments without using large shared wallets. It allows new community members to spin up deployments without access to a faucet.\nInflationary Curve: An automatic curve mechanism that autocorrects when the inflation differs from the plan outlined in the whitepaper. This removes the need for human intervention where governance proposals would need to be quickly submitted to implement a fix.\n\nThe full list of developments Akash is planning for 2022 can be found on its roadmap. According to Akash founder Greg Osuri, most of the fourth-quarter deliverables from 2021 have been developed and are still in the process of being implemented into production.\n\nAkash\u2019s target markets, from Web3 to artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML), continue to grow in parallel. As the Web3 crowd seeks decentralized computing infrastructure and the heavy-duty compute crowd seeks low-cost flexible solutions to deploy software, Akash will have many opportunities to meet the demands of the thriving cloud compute user base.\n\nDecentralized Cloud Competition\n\nAkash is not the only blockchain project disrupting the nearly half-trillion-dollar cloud computing market. Other decentralized competitors include Dfinity (Internet Computer), Ankr, and Cudos. Although Ankr launched with a similar model to Akash, today, Internet Computer and Ankr both approach cloud computing from different perspectives. Meanwhile, Cudos nearly replicates Akash.\n\nDfinity / Internet Computer\n\nWhile Internet Computer is mostly considered a smart contract platform, it seeks to decentralize everything in its protocol, from the consensus algorithm to the servers the validation nodes connect to when approving network transactions that get broadcasted through the internet.\n\nIt\u2019s not that unique to claim decentralization of the consensus algorithm. Nearly every project claims it, but few actually adhere to it (looking at Solana \u2014 validators can\u2019t plan a network restart on a decentralized system). However, Internet Computer also claims to decentralize the servers its validator nodes utilize to perform consensus. This is in stark contrast to Ethereum, where roughly 25% of the nodes were being operated on centralized AWS infrastructure in 2019.\n\nInternet Computer is not a direct competitor to Akash\u2019s marketplace for underutilized computing resources. Instead, it created a system where independent node operators pay data centers to host their nodes while cloud providers get compensated for contributing computing capacity that facilitates network activity. By pairing computing resources provided by independently operated data centers around the world with its node operators, Internet Computer has attempted to make a truly decentralized protocol running on a decentralized network of data centers as opposed to AWS-owned servers. Despite similarly making use of excess computing power, Internet Computer does not generate market activity for cloud computing like Akash. It may take a share of potential cloud providers but does not seriously threaten Akash\u2019s marketplace.\n\nAnkr\n\nThe Ankr project launched with the intention to use idle computing resources in data centers to build an open-source cloud that it was going to call the \u201cdistributed cloud computing network.\u201d This would have made Ankr a near replica and direct competitor to Akash. However, instead of letting users run any application on Ankr\u2019s proposed cloud service, it pivoted to specifically providing access to Web3 infrastructure via RPCs (Remote Procedure Calls) that are used for making requests of server processes.\n\nExclusively focusing on Web3, node providers join the Ankr network to offer cloud services that connect those building decentralized apps, protocols, and smart contracts to various blockchains through API endpoints. Ankr uses its global node delivery system and developer toolkit to service over 50 PoS blockchains. Similar to the Internet Computer, the nodes in Ankr\u2019s ecosystem that support its RPC layer may only threaten the number of providers Akash is able to connect to. Again, this does not seriously threaten Akash\u2019s marketplace.\n\nCudos\n\nCudos is another item in the product line offered by the Cudo Network. With Cudo Network\u2019s Cudo Miner product (different from Cudos), any user wishing to mine must download the Cudo Miner application, select a token to mine, and the application will mine the selected token while the machine sits idle. In the same spirit of utilizing idle compute power, Cudos will offer a very similar product to Akash with a marketplace that would connect cloud providers with underutilized resources to builders wishing to deploy WASM containers and virtual machines.\n\nAs of writing, Cudos is building its mainnet using the Cosmos SDK, while its testnet is accessible from the Big Dipper block explorer. Despite connecting idle compute power with builders, Cudos has no plans to operate its marketplace with a reverse auction or make its source code open-source like Akash. With yet to launch its mainnet, Cudos is far behind Akash in capturing market share from both the supply-side and demand-side of the cloud market.\n\nVMs\u2026 Maybe Later\n\nVirtual machines (VMs) are an extension of the old guard, the way virtualization solutions used to be implemented, and Akash does not have any explicit plans of supporting them. In a conversation with Akash founder Greg Osuri, he mentioned that compute providers have no restrictions on providing VM support \u2014 and that one even expressed interest \u2014 but that at this stage in Akash\u2019s development, it wouldn\u2019t make much sense. As a growing protocol, Akash is focused on supporting the technology with an expanding user base, not the one that enterprises use as an excuse to avoid change.\n\nAlthough some industry doubts remain on containers\u2019 ability to handle heavy-duty applications like artificial intelligence and machine learning in a similar manner to VMs, studies have proven negligible differences, if not better performance from containers. Akash recognizes the accelerating cloud compute demand for AI/ML and is preparing to handle the potential growth outside of its typical Web3 tenants.\n\nA Compliment, not a Killer\n\nAkash is not meant to replace the centralized cloud computing industry, it will simply complement it. If the conspirators are right, Ethereum might actually get killed by Solana, Polkadot, Cosmos, NEAR, or Algorand (not really, but a long-time Algonaut can dream). Cloud Computing and Akash\u2019s fit in the industry is different. Similar to how Airbnb is not destroying hotels, Akash is not destroying centralized data providers. Both Airbnb and Akash simply allow individuals to rent out unused capacity.\n\nAkash may be able to entice cloud customers by offering prices at a fraction of the cost of the big three providers, as well as providing the flexibility of no vendor lock-ins and control over the resources used to host deployments. As traditional enterprises build out crypto divisions and become more literate in Web3 technologies, Akash will be at the forefront of the decentralized cloud computing space with a functioning mainnet and a business model that alleviates supply-side inefficiencies.  \n\n\u2014\n\n**This report was commissioned by Akash, a member of Protocol Services.

Just as the current version of the internet caters to different needs, blockchains need to be able to provide a variety of services. Parachains solve this.\u201d - Polkadot founder Gavin Wood\n\n  \nKey Takeaways\n\nPolkadot\u2019s first 11 parachains are live.\nThe first 11 parachains bonded 126 million DOT (11% of the total supply; worth $2.1 billion) for the two year lease periods.\nEach parachain brings unique functionality and use-cases to the ecosystem.\nThe next major technical task is the buildout of the Cross-Consensus Message Format (XCM).\n\nIntroduction - Parachains Are Live\n\nOn Dec. 17, 2021, five years after conception, Polkadot successfully completed its multi-stage launch with the launches of the inaugural parachains. Now that parachains are live, end users are finally transacting on Polkadot.\n\nWhat\u2019s a parachain? A parachain is an application-specific, highly customized Layer-1 developed with Polkadot\u2019s blockchain development framework Substrate. It has its own economy, token, governance, and users like legacy Layer-1s. However, unlike legacy Layer-1s, a parachain is not siloed. Instead, it is connected to the Relay Chain, Polkadot\u2019s other major technical component.\n\nWhat\u2019s the Relay Chain? The Relay Chain is the nucleus of Polkadot. It is the Layer-0 base chain housing all validators and responsible for securing, governing, and connecting the parachains. In addition to the Relay Chain governance, the parachains also have sovereign governance, which is further explained in the analogy below. The Relay Chain can support an estimated 100 to 250 parachains. The parachain cap is primarily driven by the costs associated with scaling Polkadot\u2019s Cross-Chain Message Passing (XCMP) and abiding to the optimal 10:1 validator-to-parachain ratio to maintain decentralization and performance quality.\n\nAnalogy: The United States. The Relay Chain is the federal government, and parachains are individual states. The federal government secures, governs, and unites the individual states. At the same time, states secure, govern, and coordinate themselves. Should a dispute ever arise, the federal government outranks state governments.\n\nWhat does the Polkadot token (DOT) do? Polkadot\u2019s native token DOT is a utility and governance token used for participating in governance, transaction fees, security via staking, and bonding for parachain slots. As of March 2022, DOT is the <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/messari-fund-analysis-q4-21-examining-liquid-portfolios-of-crypto-funds\">most commonly held asset</a> among crypto funds.\n\n For a deeper dive into Polkadot, please see our previous reports <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/polkadot-primer?referrer=asset:polkadot\">Polkadot Primer One</a> and <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/the-polkadot-kusama-ecosystem?referrer=asset:polkadot\">Polkadot Primer Two</a> \n\nIn addition to the VC funding, Polkadot\u2019s unique architecture paired with the flexibility of Substrate has attracted the second largest developer community. Now that parachains are live and the massive VC funding is secured, the fruits of the developers\u2019 labor are accessible to the masses. In this report we will delve into Polkadot's first 11 parachains.\n\nEcosystem Overview - The First 11 Parachains\n\nAs noted above, the Relay Chain can support an estimated 100 to 250 parachains. For a parachain to gain access to the myriad of benefits offered by the Relay Chain, it must win a candle-style parachain slot auction by bonding the most DOT.\n\n  \nProspective parachains raise DOT, often via their communities, in exchange for their native tokens. At random times in the candle auction, the parachain with the most bonded DOT wins the slot. At the conclusion of the lease period, the lender's bonded DOT is returned (and they keep the parachain token).\n\n  \nAfter 11 auctions, 126 million DOT (11% of the total supply; worth $2.1 billion) has been bonded. The first batch of winners (auctions 1\u20135) were onboarded to Polkadot on Dec. 17, 2021. The second batch of winners (auctions 6\u201311) were onboarded to Polkadot on Mar. 11, 2022. Each of the winners brings unique functionality and use-cases to the Polkadot ecosystem.\n\n  \nNote not all functionality described below is active\n\nAcala\n\nAcala won Polkadot\u2019s first auction with 32,515,980 DOT raised. Acala is a decentralized finance network built on Polkadot, which powers the aUSD stablecoin ecosystem. Acala boasts a suite of financial functionality centered around aUSD:\n\n  \nAcala Dollar (aUSD)\n\nThe Acala Dollar (aUSD) is a stablecoin generated by the Honzon protocol - a Maker DAO (DAI) inspired mechanism. Users mint aUSD by creating an over-collateralized debt position with approved reserve assets like DOT, LDOT, and ACA. The team plans to expand collaterals to BTC, ETH, and native tokens of other parachains. Acala, along with an initial nine Polkadot parachain teams and several supporting venture funds, has launched a $250 million aUSD Ecosystem Fund. As of Mar. 8, 2022, 6.17 million aUSD have been issued.\n\n  \nLiquid Staking (L-Token)\n\nAcala boasts liquid staking functionality via the Homa protocol. Users stake their tokens and receive L-Tokens (e.g. LDOT) which represent the principal staked asset plus the staking yield continuously accruing. L-Tokens are accessible as ERC-20 and Substrate based tokens and can be used across Acala\u2019s DeFi protocols.\n\nAcala Swap\n\nAcala Swap is a constant-product AMM DEX supporting ERC-20 and native Substrate based tokens. Acala Swap is running a liquidity bootstrapping event to celebrate its kick-off. Users can pay gas fees on Acala swap in any token.\n\nAcala Token - ACA\n\nThe <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/acala-polkadot-s-likely-inaugural-tenant?referrer=asset:acala\">Acala token (ACA)</a> is a utility and governance token used for participating in governance, transaction fees, and incentivizing Acala collator nodes.\n\n  \nAdditionally, Acala has a partnership with fintech unicorn Current, a community-run treasury, and Acala EVM+ enabling full-stack composability between EVM and Substrate. As of early March 2022, Acala has $528 million in TVL. You can find the Acala roadmap here.  \n\n  \nMoonbeam\n\nMoonbeam won Polkadot\u2019s second auction with 35,759,931 DOT raised. Moonbeam is an EVM-compatible, cross-chain smart contract platform. Moonbeam allows developers to port their projects with minimal to no code changes, and provides a developer friendly environment for launching new projects:\n\nEthereum-Style Unified Accounts\n\nAny parachain can offer an EVM implementation by enabling the frontier pallet designed by Parity and Moonbeam. However, parachains with an EVM implementation require users to have private keys for both the EVM and Substrate account. Moonbeam offers Unified Accounts - users only need one private key (the EVM style key) to interact with EVM and Substrate. The Unified Account functionality allows users to use their existing accounts on Moonbeam, and use the Metamask wallet.\n\nXC-20 Assets\n\nMoonbeam introduced the XC-20 token class, a new token class offering the native interoperability of Substrate based assets, while allowing users and developers to interact through the familiar ERC-20 interface.\n\nMoonbeam Token - GLMR\n\nThe Moonbeam Token (GLMR) is a utility and governance token used for participating in governance, transaction fees (80% burned and 20% allocated to on-chain treasury), incentivizing Moonbeam collator nodes, and supporting the gas metering of smart contract execution.\n\n  \nAs of early March 2022, Moonbeam has $141 million in TVL with a growing ecosystem. Moonbeam plans on supporting new projects with grants and bounty programs.\n\nAstar Network  \nAstar Network won Polkadot\u2019s third auction with 10,333,552 DOT raised. Astar is a multi-chain smart contract platform supporting Web Assembly (WASM) and EVM. Astar provides multiple solutions for developers to build smart contracts:\n\nCross-Virtual Machine (X-VM)\n\nToday, virtual machines are disconnected and struggle to communicate e.g. the ability to call a Substrate contract within an EVM contract. To unify the various smart contract engines, Astar is developing the Cross-Virtual Machine (X-VM). X-VM allows smart contracts to execute calls and read storage data from different virtual machines and languages.\n\nZK Solutions\n\nAstar has been developing ZK scaling solutions. In the near future, Astar will implement the ZK plonk pallet (the plonk is called universal ZK Snark).\n\n  \ndApp Staking\n\nWhen building applications, developers often face a plethora of fees with no offsetting income. dApp staking is a reward mechanism for developers or administrators of smart contracts. Astar staking rewards are sent to application developers based on a dynamic rewards model. Eventually, Astar will allocate 50% of staking rewards to developers. Astar also plans to introduce functionality allowing developers to fund their project(s) directly from supporters.\n\n  \nAstar Token - ASTR\n\nThe Astar Token (ASTR) is a utility and governance token used for participating in governance, transaction fees, incentivizing Astar collator nodes, dApp staking, and Layer Two application support.\n\n  \nAdditionally, Astar supports Polkadot's largest DEX by TVL ArthSwap, recently raised a $22 million round led by Polychain, and has two Ethereum bridges. As of early March 2022, Astar has $386 million in TVL. Astar plans on connecting with Cosmos and adding a host of additional functionality.\n\nParallel Finance\n\nParallel Finance won Polkadot\u2019s fourth auction with 10,751,519 DOT raised (79% raised through the Parallel Auction Loan Platform). Parallel is a DeFi platform boasting a suite of functionality:\n\nMoney Market\n\nParallel\u2019s decentralized Money Market protocol offers lending, borrowing, and staking functionality. Users who opt to stake can participate in leverage staking. Leverage staking allows users to lend and stake simultaneously, thus earning double yield. How? When a user stakes DOT, they receive a liquid derivative token xDOT. xDOT can be lent back to Parallel to receive a lending fee in addition to the present staking yield.

This week marks two consecutive weeks where all sectors covered have finished in green territory. The gaming sector has seen some solid performance over the past two weeks, finishing top second last week and now leading the pack with a 19.51% return. Top assets by market capitalization were next up, gaining 14.28% on the week. The rest of the sectors covered brought in single-digit returns ranging from 8.49% for smart contract platforms to 5.61% for currencies.\n\nTop Assets\n\nAfter some time out of the spotlight, Cardano (ADA) is back. This time leading the group by a large margin and securing a 34.4% gain on the week. Catalysts behind the alternate Layer-1 asset\u2019s recent performance could be related to the token making up the largest percentage within Grayscale\u2019s \u201cSmart Contract Platform ex Ethereum Fund\u201d and Coinbase recently announcing support for ADA staking. All other assets within the category ended the week with positive returns. Solana (SOL) took the second spot, returning 17.2%, followed by Dogecoin (DOGE) with 17.0%, Polkadot (DOT) with 14.5%, and Ethereum (ETH) with 11.8% amongst the double-digit gainers.\n\nDeFi Assets\n\nLoopring has rocketed to the number one position this week within the top ten DeFi assets category after news of its integration with GameStop for their upcoming NFT marketplace. Through this partnership, GameStop will build their NFT marketplace on top of the Loopring L2, a scaling solution that will enable users to mint and trade NFTs at a fraction of the cost of transacting through the Ethereum mainnet, whilst inheriting its security. Other notable performers within the top DeFi assets by market capitalization were Uniswap (UNI) which returned 18.5%, Curve (CRV) with 12.6%, and PancakeSwap (CAKE) with 10.1%.\n\nSmart Contract Platforms\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC) has secured its spot as the best performing asset within the top 100 assets by market capitalization this week. The Ethereum Classic blockchain\u2019s ETC token saw its price increase by 75.5% on the week, driven around speculation that current ETH miners will embrace ETC mining after the upcoming Ethereum merge. Among the other smart contract platform assets with double-digit returns were Cardano (ADA) returning 34.4%, NEAR Protocol (NEAR) with 19.2%, Solana (SOL) with 17.2%, Polkadot (DOT) with 14.5%, and Ethereum with 11.8%.\n\nCurrencies\n\nThe currencies sector had an impressive week, with 7 of its top 10 assets posting double-digit gains. Leading the sector was Dash (DASH) with a 33.9% return. The Bitcoin fork token broke off from the pack early during the week and was able to continue its upwards trend while the rest of the assets in the category flattened out. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) secured the second position with a 25.5% return, and Zcash (ZEC) trailed closely, taking third place with a 23.6% gain.\n\nWeb3\n\nWeb3\u2019s outperformer this week was Audius (AUDIO). The decentralized music streaming protocol\u2019s token had a significant jump in price on the 19th which was able to maintain until the end of the week, allowing it to easily secure the first spot at a 44.6% gain. Next up were Theta (THETA) with a 16.5% return and Livepeer posting a 15.1% gain.\n\nGaming\n\nPLA (PLA) did not seem poised to have a breakout week as it traded well within the pack for most of the time. The same can be said about Axie Infinity (AXS); however, these two tokens saw their price surge substantially within the last two days of the week. PLA led the sector this week as it secured a 59.9% gain, while Axie followed with a 46.0% return. Enjin (ENJ) was the third-best performer, bringing in 20.6%.\n\n", "references": [{"name": "Guillermo Avil\u00e9s", "url": ""}], "published_at": "2022-03-25T14:09:00Z", "author": {"name": "Guillermo Avil\u00e9s"}, "tags": ["Macro"], "url": "https://messari.io/article/weekly-recap-ending-march-24"}, {"id": "167cfff0-6701-413c-96a0-c9765d1e6c91", "title": "Pocket Network: A Decentralized Solution to Access Handling", "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nThe dependence on centralized infrastructure creates single points of failure and degrades the promise of decentralization.\nPocket Network addresses Web3\u2019s access handling side with a censorship-resistant node network, zero downtime and no sunk cost to applications.\nPocket is designed to facilitate a multichain future, integrating with over 40 blockchains and growing rapidly in average daily relay servicing (52x YoY) and the number of service nodes (24x YoY).\nDespite Pocket\u2019s high inflation, the linear rewarding with serviced relay volume resulted in a 30% increase in total POKT supply in three months. Subsequent concerns around stakeholder dilution drove the DAO to tame inflation.\nPocket\u2019s upcoming massive V1 upgrade is a significant step towards a highly scalable network equipped with enterprise-grade service quality.\n\nThe recent Web3 proliferation has been quite a lure for the intellectually agile. Both builders and skeptics gathered around its fire and started participating in the show. With the recent market volatility, the stars guiding investors dimmed their lights on builders. Once perceived as rockstars, builders slowly gave the spotlight to skeptics, as if it was their time to shine. As large as the scope of commentary was, most of the balanced criticisms converged on specific argument patterns, with the incomplete decentralization of blockchain networks taking the lead.\n\nOn Tradeoffs\n\nCritics often describe the networks as being built around an illusion of decentralization. They point out that hash rates have been consolidated into only a few mining pools and that smart contract platforms depend too much on private infrastructure providers, which could become centralized points of failure. Although these criticisms on the incomplete trustlessness problem are intrinsically valid, things tend to get more nuanced on the battlefield. When applications optimize for cost efficiency, they often opt for a centralization trade-off, especially when the costs significantly outweigh the benefits of decentralization. On top of that, centralized infrastructures provide high-quality service, making them a superior choice on multiple fronts.\n\nAs a means to an end, decentralization is potentially not a scalable design choice. To move away from a centralized infrastructure would require distributed solutions with enterprise-grade service qualities. Quality, cost, and decentralization are the three heads of the chimera that Web3 infrastructure providers need to execute in order to have a chance of broad adoption.\n\nPocket: Information Routing in a Blockchain Transaction\n\nEnter Pocket Network, a full-node coordination engine. Pocket strives to become a leading decentralized access solution by simultaneously tackling three fronts: censorship-resistant RPC handling services, zero downtime, and no sunk costs.\n\nThe Pocket Network aims to disrupt a specific step in a regular blockchain transaction. For instance, in an Ethereum transaction, smart contracts are filled with logical, Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible directives. Whenever interacting with these contracts, users first need to submit their request to an Ethereum full node equipped with EVM. This full node can be a local or external node. If the user runs a local full node, they can read the chain data as well as validate the transaction to broadcast to the network without an external connector. However, running a full node is a costly and inefficient activity and is limited by performance issues such as downtimes and high latency. Instead of taking on this operational overhead, applications refer to node services to acquire chain data and handle their transactions.\n\nSource: BlockChannel\n\nAccessing a server, or in this case accessing a blockchain through an external node, requires the user to determine a first interaction point. Who will give the information about the chain state? Who will take the first transaction request in case of a write request? Which node will play the role of a customs and see if the submitted transaction is valid before releasing it to the chain? This first non-local interaction point is determined using RPC, an API that allows the application to send their request to a specified full node via a URL.\n\nEvery interaction, both state-changing transactions and information requests, involves this path. When users do a particular action on their wallet, it triggers a call, resulting in an API request routed to a full node. For example, Metamask chooses Infura as their default RPC endpoint provider. If a user wanted to send funds to another address or to check their own wallet's token balance, Metamask would route their request to the nodes operated by Infura.\n\nThe lack of a well-developed decentralized alternative before Pocket Network made applications heavily rely upon centralized node providers such as Infura and Alchemy. The centralization of these gateways makes the network susceptible to single points of failure with unexpected downtimes and the threat of censorship. A fresh case of censorship occurred with Infura and Metamask accidentally blocking transactions originating from Venezuela.\n\nPocket Network\u2019s decentralized RPC protocol is designed to obviate these kinds of problems with a distributed full-node network that is designed to be highly redundant. Contrary to the centralized incumbents who are bound to operational bottlenecks when expanding, Pocket Network is relieved of the burden of running their own nodes, operating similarly to prominent marketplaces like Uber and Airbnb. As a coordination-providing intermediary network, Pocket can remain chain agnostic, function as an L0 despite being an L1, and rapidly scale the services into new chains. So far, the network has been able to attract 34,000 service nodes (and counting) while expanding to more than 40 networks within a brief amount of time. Thus, Pocket became one of the fastest-growing decentralized infrastructure providers in the space.\n\nHow Pocket Helps Bridge Multiple Blockchain Worlds\n\nFundamentally, the design of the Pocket Network V0 is akin to the mythological tree Yggdrasil, with numerous network integrations reaching to blockchain worlds like branches, fostering them with essential information. Meanwhile, the service is grounded in three components like Yggdrasil\u2019s three roots: application, nodes, and network layer.\n\nIn the Pocket ecosystem, applications are the agents operating on smart contract protocols like Ethereum and Harmony. They seek API request handling services from Pocket\u2019s distributed node system, constituting the demand side of the network. On the market\u2019s supply side dwell two types of nodes ensuring that the information bridging demand of applications is met: service nodes and validator nodes.\n\nAnyone who downloads the chain history can run a full node and connect applications with relay handlers as well as being able to secure the network. However, Pocket requires nodes to stake at least 15,000 POKT to be eligible for handling application API requests and thus perform interchain information dissemination. These relay handlers are the service nodes that sit between the Pocket Network and the external blockchain, performing the essential part of the network\u2019s magic by running a Pocket full node and at least one RelayChain node (a full node on integrated networks) to connect the applications with the external networks. Among these service nodes, the top 1000 by staked amount can become the validator nodes. Validators check if service nodes handle relays and forging blocks with valid transactions through the Pocket\u2019s implementation of Tendermint PoS.\n\nThe third component, the network layer, is a set of rules that lies underneath, orchestrating critical operations such as application to service node coordination, reward and punishment mechanisms, and dispute settlements.\n\nReal-world transaction\n\nAlthough applications are the primary users of the Pocket Network, regular Web3 wanderers may also experience how the possible TCP/IP of the Web3 node infrastructure works by changing the Metamask RPC route to Pocket\u2019s public nodes. Applications refer to Pocket\u2019s facilitating website Portal to demand an RPC endpoint, which is currently the sole access point for applications. More direct and censorship-resistant integration through PocketJS will be enabled with permissionless app staking.\n\nIn contrast to the subscription-based payment model of the centralized providers, Pocket Network doesn\u2019t request direct payment from applications to mint a dedicated RPC endpoint. Instead, it adopts a stake-to-use model that requires users to stake POKT in order to access services.\n\nApplications can choose between a free tier or stake-based subscription. Pocket\u2019s free tier option serves the same number of relays as Infura\u2019s $225/mo subscription plan: 1 million relays/day. Applications can subscribe to the free tier, or preferentially, they can stake POKT and benefit from additional relaying services proportional to their staked amount (~130 relay/POKT at the time of writing). Nevertheless, app staking will not become permissionless until the protocol\u2019s major V1 upgrade to ensure sustainable scaling and high-quality service. As it will remain capped to an arbitrary number of app stakes (currently 2,298) with the Portal able to share a stake between multiple applications, most applications subscribe to the free tier and let Pocket Foundation cover their entry costs.\n\nPocket\u2019s access dashboard Portal is equipped with tools to support service quality. Before matching applications with service nodes, it runs a sync check and its Cherry Picker to make sure the nodes are synced to the chain\u2019s current state and operate on low latency. As applications start using their dedicated URL to send information to a non-native chain (e.g., requesting to see the total deposit amount in an Aave lending pool), a Pocket full node dispatches their relaying request to the network and initiates a session between them and the service nodes.\n\nSessions are regularly updated data structures that dictate which service nodes handle relay requests of the application for a predetermined time interval. Currently, an application is matched with 24 service nodes in a session, and the relaying service continues for four Pocket blocks before getting tumbled. The same 24 nodes typically serve an application for approximately one hour before a new session starts and the application is paired with a new set of nodes.\n\nSource: Pocket Network\n\nService nodes route relay requests to and from the non-native chain and keep track of the number of relays delivered. After the session is complete, they bundle them in batches and send them as proof-of-relays to Finality Storage. Validator nodes check the legitimacy of proofs to see if service nodes indeed provided the service. Then they forge Pocket blocks with valid transactions.\n\nAt the end of the block production, if the relays are valid and the application didn\u2019t invoke Challenge Transaction to challenge the proof-of-relay, the network mints tokens proportional to the volume of relays (currently 0.00843 POKT/relay). The reward pool is distributed among facilitators as such:\n\nService Nodes: 89% of the minted POKT\nPocket DAO: 10%\nValidator Nodes: 1%\n\nService nodes take the lion\u2019s share of the rewards. Coupling this form of generalized mining that leverages POKT as a unit of work with the lucrative return potential for the service nodes, the network experienced quite the success in building the supply side. This translated into a ~24 times the YoY growth, currently sitting at over 34,500.\n\nAdd to this zero downtime, no sunk cost, and censorship-resistant service provision, as well as Pocket\u2019s appealing free tier option. All of these have helped the network nurture the demand side of the market. Right now, the protocol handles over 200 million relays a day on average, indicating an increase of ~52x YoY. The significant uptick in average daily relays followed Pocket Network\u2019s integration with Harmony in October 2021. As Harmony users had issues with the default RPC providers and switching to Pocket alleviate these problems, Pocket captured a substantial amount of the network traffic right after the integration. As of today, approximately 150 million of the   200 million daily relays originate from the Harmony network.\n\nIn 2021, the network served 6.4 billion relays to Harmony, followed by Ethereum with 3.7 billion. Although these numbers seem somewhat small compared to Infura\u2019s 12 billion daily calls in 2019 and 2 billion daily ethcalls in 2020, the growth of the Pocket Network still merits attention. It took ten months for Pocket to hit the first billion cumulative relays milestone and only another six months to handle the same number of relays in less than a week.\n\nTokeneconomics and Reward Mechanism\n\nThere is a delicate relationship between a chain\u2019s technical capabilities and its economic model. Both need to uniquely coincide to permit the desired coordination game to unfold with success. With community concern centered around the sustainability of highly inflationary tokeneconomics, the protocol's economic life cycle is divided into three phases with which the POKT incentivization mechanism is calibrated to attain fast growth first and later switch to a more sustainable economy.\n\nAfter establishing a solid supply side in the Bootstrapping Phase, the protocol is currently in its Growth Phase, where the high inflation rates are intrinsic to its expansion strategy. In the same way Pool 2 attracts liquidity in DeFi, the Growth Phase of the tokeneconomics model revolves around the economic flywheel where a high APR on the native token attracts service liquidity, which in turn accelerates the growth of relay service capabilities and network integrations.\n\nWhen the growth of inflation becomes higher than the growth of total staked POKT supply and when the POKT price appreciates to a sustainable level, the Pocket DAO will initiate the\n\nMaturity Phase\n\nOverall, the POKT tokeneconomics is designed to attract long-term participants and diminish unproductive speculation. This vision is materialized in two instances: covertly banishing non-participant tokenholders from the network through high inflation rates and separating the right to governance from token holdership via merit-based vote claim.\n\nHowever, the truth is there is growing inflationary pressure on staked tokens with increased network adoption, due to node providers getting paid with freshly minted tokens for their relaying services. The rapid increase in total token supply tarnishes Pocket\u2019s low-cost stake-to-use payment model with a non-negligible dilution cost. Due to the protocol-implemented cap on staked apps, the discrepancy between the increased actual demand and total supply causes speculative price appreciation to remain essential for taming the turbulent difference sustaining the network growth.\n\nTo give a concrete example, the total POKT supply increased from 660 million to 960 million in the last six months, considerably diluting any application stake at the time. Yet, the inflation has been proportional to the increase in the number of relays. Hence, an increase in average daily relays combined with a speculative appreciation has offset the dilutive effect with an increase in overall network value, turning any upfront cost done at the time to a ~2x accounting profit.\n\nIn other words, the market demand allowed a positive ROI for the early adopters. However, after witnessing exponential growth in the last couple of months, the discrepancy between demand and supply became more apparent. The community acted quickly and recently passed two proposals to implement a more sustainable inflation mechanism. By adopting a gradually declining inflation, they aim to stabilize network dynamics and introduce protection to network stakeholders before any token burning starts.\n\nAs the inflationary pressures of Pocket\u2019s linear token minting punish non-participant tokenholders during rapid network expansions, POKT speculators have sought ways to generate income with their tokens. The most popular solution has been node financing, where POKT holders allocate their tokens to node runners for a share of the service. This service can only be accessed through custodial services. Moreover, the amount of staked POKT has no influence over the selection chances for a session, causing service node operators to strategically distribute their POKTs to multiple wallets and maximize the number of eligible wallets they hold.\n\nBoth of these phenomenons have a magnifying effect on the supply, thus affecting assessments on the meaningful supply-side growth. Although Pocket's ADR / ASN growth indicates that the network experienced a somewhat balanced adoption last year, a large portion of the relay handling capacity remains underutilized. Recently, the growth of the supply side started to significantly outpace the demand side, meaning that the average node profitability has been declining since its local peak on January 7, 2022.\n\nV1 Upgrade\n\nUntil recently, one deal-breaker for apps was the high latency of the network compared to centralized solutions. However, Pocket managed to tackle this problem and achieve a competitive latency by increasing the number of nodes in a session from 5 to 24 and improving its latency filters.\n\nSource: Internal test conducted by the Pocket Network team.\n\nOn top of that, the Pocket team is laser-focused on improving service quality with their massive V1 upgrade. The transition to V1 will comprise consequential alterations that will prepare the Pocket Network to scale its relay services by orders of magnitude. It aims to further lower the latency and boost the network in many ways with a novel chain architecture. Not expected to launch until at least the following year, the upgrade will offer new design mechanisms on four different modules of the chain: utility, consensus, peer-to-peer, and persistence.\n\nBecause Pocket Network must maintain a service quality on par with centralized competitors, they intend to incorporate massive enhancements to their incentivization and inspection mechanisms to further optimize the network for high-quality servicing.\n\nA major change is the addition of a new network agent. The underutilization of proof-of-relay challenging (Client-side Challenge Feature) and the inconvenience attached to the fail-first-correct-later approach drove Pocket to introduce a new agent in V1, fisherman. Disguised as an application, this new agent will play the role of an inspector and score nodes on availability, latency, and consistency of their services.\n\nPocket\u2019s V1 will also incorporate a quality-focused reward mechanism. In V0, Cherry Picker ranked nodes by their latency and made sure those with high latency got fewer chances for servicing. Like Cherry Picker\u2019s filtering, this new mechanism will distribute relay rewards not according to the individual relay volume but to the test scores provided by fishermen.\n\nBecause scaling to handle trillions of relays requires a vastly robust infrastructure, Pocket\u2019s V1 will focus on ensuring the network is ready to scale on all fronts. At the moment, Tendermint BFT requires extensive communication between nodes which causes a bottleneck for scaling the number of nodes. In V1, the protocol will adopt its own implementation of HotStuff BFT. This will be assisted with the introduction of task-specialized communication and an effective message dispersion method. Transitioning from random gossip of Tendermint BFT to structured gossip is expected to result in lower bandwidth usage and higher network efficiency.\n\nThe introduction of the quality-inspecting fishermen will also help network scale. Using these new agents, the network will be able to tinker with the protocol design to accommodate more clear-cut roles for nodes. Recently, the protocol separated tasks between validator nodes and service nodes to make sure they were less bound by each other\u2019s requirements. V1 aims to double down on the specialization feature by stripping the responsibility of keeping track of relay proofs away from service nodes thanks to fishermen. Thus, the network will make requests handling the sole responsibility of service nodes and allow them to allocate resources to increase network efficiency.\n\nV0 allowed developers to access RPC handling services with zero downtime and without the sunk cost of a subscription-based payment model. V1 will primarily focus on doubling down on the current value propositions instead of expanding the scope of operations. Since the permissionless app staking and the ultimate design for scalability won\u2019t be unleashed until V1, the network\u2019s true potential will remain unrevealed until this significant upgrade.\n\nConclusion\n\nOne may argue that the current permissioned state of Pocket's Portal is a sign of faux decentralization. One could further their argument by saying that not all nodes are created equal according to Pocket\u2019s proof-of-useful-work (generalized mining) mechanism. And the current node concentration might increase even more with professional node providers gaining an edge with V1 quality measures.\n\nFirstly, it might be counter-productive to get lost in often mismatched linguistic interfaces while arguing about the definitions and immediately condemning a practice if it doesn\u2019t exactly fit our ideal. Instead, it might be more pragmatic to take any endeavor that strives for diminishing the total censorable points of failure and consider it a cherishable improvement.\n\nSecondly, Pocket aims to thwart these with the eventual transition to permissionless application access, optimizing efficiency in V1 to lower technical requirements to run a node, and introducing a more granular geolocalization to give small nodes a competitive edge. Therefore, its full decentralization is also subject to a gradual process.\n\nFinally, Web3 needs a more decentralized infrastructure. As such, a multichain future dependent on seamless integrations between multiple networks requires decentralized infrastructure even more. As the focus for the last years primarily rested on enhancing the smart contract ecosystem with L2s and alternative L1s, the importance of decentralized middleware remains to be explored. With its distributed node network to tackle one of the pain points of the space, Pocket might be the missing point in the grand picture of decentralization as it carries the potential to help the space move away from centralized incumbents.\n\nCritics might call the current permissioned state of Pocket\u2019s Portal an example of faux decentralization. They might label Pocket\u2019s proof-of-useful-work mechanism (generalized mining) an unfair advantage for professional node providers. But instead of arguing about semantics, the focus of the conversation should be on Pocket\u2019s endeavor to diminish the total censorable points of failure, which is a cherishable improvement. Beyond that, Pocket aims to refute its critics\u2019 claims by gradually transitioning to permissionless application access, optimizing efficiency in V1 to lower the technical requirements to run a node, and introducing a more granular geolocalization to give small nodes a competitive edge.\n\nPocket\u2019s eventual move to full decentralization will meet Web3\u2019s need for a more decentralized infrastructure. Because a multichain future depends on the seamless integration between multiple networks, the focus for the last several years has been on enhancing the smart contract ecosystem with L2s and alternative L1s. With its distributed node network acting as a decentralized middleware, Pocket Network can become the key to helping the space move away from centralized incumbents.\n\nThis report was commissioned by Pocket Network, a member of Protocol Services.

Instead, companies manage a scattershot collection of fragmented social media accounts to communicate with their users. When it comes to new feature sets, margin calls, governance votes, or even potential hacks, Web3 companies today find it difficult to simply reach their users. Ethereum Push Notification Service (EPNS) aims to solve this problem by offering a multichain, Web3 approach to push notifications and decentralized wallet-to-wallet communications. The project combats fragmented Web3 communications by enabling and incentivizing direct communications between decentralized services and users, without simultaneously compromising on features like user anonymity.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine a world without push notifications. First introduced to mobile via the Apple Push Notification Service in 2009, the average American now receives 45+ daily pinged notifications to a phone, browser, or tablet. Perhaps unsurprisingly, roughly 60% of users opt-out of receiving push notifications, allowing generally only the most critical pings from financial and utility applications.\n\nDecentralized and Web3 platforms, by nature of their permissionless-ness, neither receive nor store typical user data, like names, emails, or phone numbers, which is a feature rather than a bug. It\u2019s meant to protect users from situations like a corporate data leak. Rather than permitting a company to store their data centrally, the Web3 user takes this responsibility and controls her own data, deciding when and whom to trust with that data. For companies seeking to engage and re-engage their users, though, the Web3 paradigm presents new challenges. Especially in a multichain world, where user activity spans tens or hundreds of applications across multiple blockchains, companies are finding it increasingly difficult to adequately communicate with and retain their users. On the user side, this is an equally challenging problem: interacting with multiple DeFi products requires users to constantly check metrics like liquidity margin, implied impermanent loss, or the sundowning of specific rewards programs. Look no further than the \u201cclose call\u201d from January 2022, as MakerDAO vault owner \u201c7 Siblings\u201d narrowly missed a $600 million ETH liquidation.\n\nSource: EPNS\n\nEPNS is building a detailed roadmap to alleviate this exact pain point,, incentivizing both companies and users to opt-in rather than opt-out and solving for communications fragmentation and asynchronicity in a multichain world.\n\nEPNS Enabling the Web3 Push Notification\n\nEPNS was founded in 2020 by Harsh Rajat and Richa Joshi, who together have over two decades of experience in founding and operating tech startups. Harsh and Richa are based in Mumbai, but the company employs a globally distributed team of over 30 people across development, product, and marketing. EPNS successfully closed a seed round in December 2020, raising $750 thousand at a $5 million valuation via a SAFT agreement, with participation from 25 angel investors and VCs, including Balaji Srinivasan, BlockRock Capital, LD Capital, and others. In March 2021, the company extended its SAFT offering to take on further investment, and raised $660 thousand from strategic and existing investors at a $12 million valuation. In April 2022, EPNS has announced a $10.1 million Series A funding round, with an average valuation of $131M. The round was led by Jump Crypto, with additional participation from Tiger Global, ParaFi, Sino Global Capital, Polygon Studios, DCX Ventures, Alpha Wave Capital, Zebpay, TRGC, Signum Capital, among others. The investment will be used to expand the team, grow the user base, and go multi-chain.\n\nIn the company\u2019s own language, \u201cEPNS is a protocol for blockchain-based notifications that are chain agnostic, platform independent and incentivized.\u201d The protocol enables users (wallet addresses) to receive notifications and obtain token incentives through active participation. EPNS can be thought of as a wallet-to-wallet or service-to-wallet communications network, which enables pertinent off-chain events (e.g., Snapshot proposals) and on-chain information (e.g., block confirmations) to be transmitted to specific addresses (see this post on all the ways EPNS can integrate into DeFi). The protocol is a partially permission-based system, meaning all users \u2013 i.e., contract owners, channels, or users receiving notifications \u2013 must opt-in to receive or send notifications. EPNS maintains a public key registry of all opted-in users, which it considers non-invasive information because public keys are by nature publicly searchable. \n\nAny user can create what is called a channel. A channel exists to coordinate and send notifications to the channel\u2019s subscribers. Each channel\u2019s key information, such as description, organization website, and image, are input and stored as a JSON payload on IPFS. To successfully launch, each channel also requires a staked pool to fund its operations and incentivize subscribers. The protocol regulates the minimum and maximum $DAI deposit required to stake; currently, the staked pool requirement is minimum 50 $DAI with a cap of 250,000 $DAI. Each channel\u2019s pool is directly deposited to Aave (or in the future, a similar open-source lending protocol). The yield from this deposit is distributed to channel subscribers based on a time-based distribution model. Deactivating a channel comes with a minimum 10 $DAI penalty, which is set to disincentivize users from spoofing channels. The penalty fee is ultimately deposited into a separate fee pool operated by the treasury. According to the company, the specifics around staking requirements are subject to change in future versions of the protocol, ultimately to be decided via governance vote.\n\nSource:EPNS\n\nEPNS envisions three types of channels: open, closed, and mutual. Open channels are open to all users without restriction and can indirectly subscribe users by paying them a small fee (e.g., CoinDesk). Closed channels cannot be freely subscribed to and instead pay subscribers to opt-in. Mutual channels require both parties to approve a user subscription. Once the channel is established, the EPNS protocol algorithmically maintains the appropriate incentives via its public registry by distributing staked tokens and adjusting spam ratings across its user base.\n\nEPNS operates two universal channels, \u201cEPNS Channel'' and \u201cEPNS Alerter Channel\u201d, which are intended to only send out notifications of extreme importance to all its protocol users and channels. These notifications include for instance mainnet downtime, hacks, or similar events. For universal channels, users are required to opt-out if they wish to no longer receive protocol-wide notifications.\n\nEPNS takes spam into careful consideration, as mobile notifications have historically been overly exploited for retargeting and advertising. To combat spam at the protocol level, a rating is attributed to every channel based on time since launch, user growth, and unsubscribes due to spam. This rating is from 0 to 1 (1 = bad actor), with automatic notification throttling above a score of 0.8. The throttle mechanism is intended to systematically punish spam-like behavior at the channel-level. It is currently unclear exactly how the protocol will handle disputes around specific spam ratings.\n\nThough EPNS utilizes a semi-centralized infrastructure to provide its notification and message service to decentralized applications and users (see Whitepaper \u201cIntegration Flow\u201d), the vision is to further decentralize its infrastructure over time. For instance, the company is researching the possibility of enabling a static EPNS file stored directly on IPFS that could point to a channel\u2019s website hosted on IPFS. This could enable user-to-user communication, like hashed chat feeds and even decentralized video messaging. The following diagram shows how dApps and services can integrate with EPNS today.\n\nSource: EPNS Whitepaper\n\nFurther information for integrating services with EPNS can be found under the company\u2019s smart contract documentation, which stipulates further criteria around the activation and deactivation of channels.\n\nEPNS is the simultaneous developer of five products on top of the EPNS protocol: EPNS Infra; a mobile application; a dApp; Showrunners; and a JavaScript (JS) Library. EPNS Infra is the name for the middleware which transmits data from decentralized protocols to centralized carriers like iOS, Android, and web browsers. The mobile application is the user interface (UI) for sending and receiving notifications at the user level, while the dApp enables decentralized carriers like Compound or Aave to also receive notifications. Showrunners are meant to be exemplar channels run directly by the EPNS team to show off the full capabilities of the protocol and drive interest. Showrunners include notifications for events like ENS domain expiry, Compound liquidation alerts, and gas fee idiosyncrasies. The JS Library is a product for integrating EPNS simply and efficiently into third-party apps.\n\nOn January 11, 2022, after more than a year of development, the EPNS protocol went live on the Ethereum mainnet, meaning the company\u2019s suite of products are open for use. Ahead of the mainnet launch, ChainSafe Systemscompleted an audit of the protocol in October 2021 and identified a number of bugs and issues that the company immediately fixed. As of February 2022, no known bugs or exploits have been reported.\n\n$PUSH Launch and Tokeneconomics\n\nShortly after closing their extended seed round, EPNS announced details surrounding its $PUSH token generation event (TGE), including an overview of $PUSH tokenomics. According to the TGE press release, $PUSH tokens have been capped at 100 million tokens total, which are to be split among investors, community, team, advisors, and a reserve allocation which EPNS refers to as its foundation. As part of the TGE, $PUSH tokens were sold to the public via Polkastarter ($0.12 per $PUSH), and an emission schedule for liquidity rewards was released for UNI-V2 LPs and $PUSH stakers. Of the early seed and strategic investors, 20.5 million tokens (20.5% supply) are to be allocated over 24 months following the TGE, 20% of which unlock 3 months after the TGE while 80% vest linearly over the following 21 months. The team received 16% of the token supply with a cliff 9-months after TGE plus linear vesting for the following 48 months. Advisors received 3.5 million tokens (40% of the supply), meaning the remaining 60% of the supply was reserved for the foundation (7%) and the community (53%). As both the Polkastarter raise and LP rewards represent less than 10% of community tokens, EPNS will retain a significant amount of unallocated community tokens for future distribution, giving it the flexibility to adapt to future community sentiment with novel incentive strategies.\n\n$PUSH tokens were designed to give economic incentive to tokenholders to maintain the EPNS protocol. As such, the token\u2019s key function is for governance decisions related to the protocol, such as the distribution of protocol fees, user incentives, and voting thresholds. $PUSH tokenholders benefit from receiving 70% of platform fees, while the remaining 30% of fees are distributed to an ecosystem development fund meant for onboarding new partners and providing for rewards pools. Tokenholders can delegate their $PUSH to committed community members rather than directly vote on governance issues themselves; a list of current delegates and nominess seeking to become delegates can be found on the EPNS governance dashboard. Governance proposals and votes are organized on Snapshot, with 75,000 $PUSH being required to submit a proposal and the approval threshold per governance decision varying. One recent proposal approved late January 2022, PIP-02: Incentives for Approved Proposals, provides a 200 $PUSH incentive to tokenholders whose proposal receives approval. A further 100 $PUSH is rewarded for proposals with 50% more total votes than the average of the four prior approved proposals. PIP-01: Push Grants Program (PGP) was also approved in January 2022 and is focused on attracting developers to support the further development of EPNS; PGP intends to allocate $1 million from the EPNS treasury to promising projects.\n\nEPNS operates the $PUSH incentives dashboard for its key token metrics, with up-to-date TVL, rewards issuance, and governance, as well as the Rockstars community incentive program. Current TVL sits at just over $9 million with fewer than half of LP rewards already distributed. There is currently over $3.5 million in liquidity for swaps on Uniswap, and the EPNS token ecosystem continues to onboard prominent projects in the space. The existing group of ecosystem partners can be seen in the following overview:\n\nSource: EPNS\n\nKey Partnership, Integrations, and Current Users\n\nSince launching the company in 2020, the EPNS team has established multiple partnerships within the crypto ecosystem, focusing primarily on applications where an EPNS integration can have immediate impact. As expected, most partners are operating in the Ethereum ecosystem. That said, the company is focused on providing services across multiple blockchains and intends to be adaptive to market dynamics long-term (for instance, the company plans to offer non-EVM support as soon as Q4 2022). Readers might be familiar with the company\u2019s existing and ongoing partnership with ENS, in which ENS domain owners can enable notifications of upcoming domain expiration dates. More recent integrations include Digible, an NFT marketplace, and mStable, an Ethereum-based stablecoin AMM. In January, the CEX Huobi Global partnered with EPNS to enable notifications for its users of upcoming token launches. Although a CEX like Huobi typically interacts with its users directly via email or a mobile app, EPNS offers Huobi a secondary touchpoint and opens the exchange to a further set of Web3 users. In a recent blog post covering the protocol\u2019s functionalities, EPNS mentioned MakerDAO, Crypto Volatility Index, Bancor, Oasis, Mover, ENS, Snapshot, and Coindesk \u2013 all as existing users of the EPNS protocol. The total number of projects displayed on the EPNS channel dashboard stands today at 41 (see channel dashboard), but the number of soon-to-be-integrated projects is likely much larger, considering the growing number of partnership announcements.\n\nAccounting for users, the EPNS universal channels, EPNS and EPNS Alerter, show 2,796 and 797 subscribers, respectively (as of March 4, 2022). The largest channel, Ethereum Name Service (ENS), has 4,697 subscribed users; this partnership is a strong signal for EPNS user growth, as users who register ENS domain names are prompted during the registration process to enable notifications in the event their domain expires. Without EPNS, ENS users would have no way of receiving similar alerts. Looking at the number of $PUSH token holders is another approach to assessing total users on the platform today: this number currently sits at 3,926 accounts holding $PUSH tokens.\n\nDirect and Indirect Competitors\n\nThere are numerous push notification service providers operating within Web2. In fact, Facts and Figures projects the global notifications software market to grow to north of $31 billion by 2025. This market is made up of companies like Airship, CleverTap, One Signal, and others, which primarily offer SaaS solutions for the management and automation of push notifications on desktop and mobile. Andrew Chen from a16z wrote on the topic several years back with the help of companies like Leanplum, and reported some interesting data after analyzing over 670 million push notifications. While over 60% of users opt-out of mobile push notifications, certain categories greatly outperform in terms of opt-in and engagement. Moreover, engagement with push notifications is relatively time-sensitive, in that the highest engagement occurs in the evening after work. Financial services applications have been shown to perform the best in terms of push engagement, presumably due to users typically perceiving banking or financial information as critical.\n\nConsidering how early EPNS is to the market, there are no clear direct competitors offering a similar solution. The companies that make up the SaaS push solutions are offering an approach based on a Web2 paradigm, where service providers almost always retain user data such as email addresses, phone numbers, and other identifiers and interact with their users directly via SMS, email, or in-app push. However, these companies do not currently have the capabilities to offer push services to decentralized users in any meaningful way.\n\nEPNS indirectly competes with companies like Zapper and Zerion because they offer multichain dashboard and portfolio management to simplify wallet and account management at scale. As companies like Zapper and Zerion roll out mobile applications, they become more likely to develop their own notification systems without relying on EPNS. Nevertheless, it is unlikely these dashboard platforms ship push notifications for off-chain information in the near future, as aggregating and enabling push channels does not appear to be a key focus.\n\nThe blue ocean that EPNS is operating in flips the stakes by incentivizing users to opt-in, thus driving higher engagement and likely offering more benefit to the end user. Depending on how quickly EPNS can onboard partners, the protocol could quickly acquire significant market share.\n\nFuture Vision and Roadmap\n\nThe company\u2019s roadmap for 2022 dictates a rich set of features that are headed to EPNS users. Multichain support will likely be increasingly critical as user demand continues to disperse across L1s and L2s. The company believes wallet-to-wallet communication will be live via EPNS as soon as Q3 2022. Planned updates to the UI and around channel editing functions will be critical to ensure the product matches user expectations going forward; roll-outs can be expected in the first half of 2022.\n\nWith the exponential growth of OpenSea users over the last year, enabling push notifications on OpenSea might be worth considering for EPNS, especially in light of the amount of confusion that still exists around dormant listings on the platform. Alternatively, horizontal partnerships or integrations into portfolio managers like Zerion, Zapper, or Gnosis Safe seem like a potential win-win, as these services are already beginning to integrate push notifications for trade executions and token receipts. White-labeling is likely less of a consideration since EPNS intends to decentralize its push operations long-term, meaning companies can integrate EPNS services seamlessly without the need for a tailored white-label solution.\n\nThe highest risk to EPNS is likely in its incentive mechanism, as the push business model has traditionally been based on advertising and retargeting, where advertisers pay push service providers who promise increased user engagement and higher conversions. With EPNS, the user incentives are flipped, in the same way that Brave users originally were rewarded for watching advertisements. This is, in turn, the gamble: EPNS channels must continually ensure there is a high enough upside for users who opt in, either through pool incentives or a continual supply of highly critical push notifications.\n\nConclusion\n\nEPNS is operating at the edge of the new Web3 paradigm by taking a decentralized approach to building a familiar Web2 service. With the acceleration of multichain, user will increasingly demand services that simplify UX and enable easy management of multiple accounts across blockchains. Moreover, with the right balance of incentives for companies and users, EPNS is well-positioned to solve challenges related to fragmented communications in Web3 and ultimately enable more secure and engaged ecosystems across blockchains.\n\nThis report was commissioned by EPNS, a member of Protocol Services.

The bridge is most closely associated with the light client and relay model as defined by Dmitriy Berenzon.\nBTC is locked in Vaults on the Bitcoin network, with Vault Operators providing collateral in the form of the ONE token. Relayers, who monitor the Vaults for transactions, also must provide ONE collateral.\nFee payments are made to both Relayers and Vault Operators, encouraging broad participation from different entities. Both Relayers and Vault Operators may be slashed if they fail to meet their Service Level Agreements (SLAs).\nIn the future, there is potential for a new token to govern the bridge and its parameters.\n\nWith the release of Harmony\u2019s new trustless BTC bridge comes another opportunity for BTC hodlers to put their BTC to work and participate in DeFi without liquidating any precious sats.\n\nSmart contracts are extremely difficult to build with Bitcoin Script as it is intentionally more limited - helping make Bitcoin a more secure and resilient network. Ethereum, on the other hand, came along and made tradeoffs to achieve greater smart contract functionality and Turing completeness, which is why application development and DeFi originally blossomed there, but also why contract exploits are prevalent. \u2018Turing completeness\u2019 means that creating anything within that system is theoretically possible, as long as you can break it down into logical steps. Smart contracts and the sprawling world of Web3 are an example of this: where we are limited only by our imaginations (and making these bits of code gas efficient). Since Bitcoin does not have smart contracts, it is more challenging to create conditioned and complex transactions. This makes programmatic custody of bitcoin and bridging it to other blockchains trustlessly quite a tall task. Today, the vast majority of BTC used on other chains is via centralized custodians.\n\nThis report will examine a trustless BTC bridge, the Harmony BTC bridge to be exact; a new product within the Harmony ecosystem. It is designed to be secure and completely trustless. The bridge operation, economics, and risks will be evaluated as well as the implications of BTC functioning on an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible network.\n\nA Quick Primer on Harmony\n\nHarmony is a sharded, fully Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible blockchain that utilizes an innovative consensus mechanism called Effective Proof-of-Stake (EPoS). Unlike \u2018traditional\u2019 PoS, in which the right to validate the next block is awarded via lottery or bidding, EPoS encourages decentralization by introducing a non-linear relationship between the amount of tokens staked and the chances of mining the next block. In other words, more tokens staked does not equal more rewards. Thus, stakers cannot harness economies of scale.\n\nFor a more in-depth explanation of the mechanism, check out the full EPoS explanation by the Harmony team and <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/at-one-with-harmony\">previous Messari research</a>.\n\nHarmony is also home to a burgeoning DeFi ecosystem, with TVL increasing more than four-fold in the past two months to reach over $1 billion. The majority of the TVL (60%) comes from game/DEX/NFT marketplace DeFi Kingdoms. The next biggest application by TVL is Tranquil Finance, commanding nearly $500 million.\n\nBridges Walked, So That Alt Chains Could Run\n\nThroughout 2021, the rise of L2s and many alternate L1s with liquidity incentives has meant that mercenary capital has moved from and across chains. Over $25B of value bridged across Ethereum is a testament to this.\n\nBridges are the vital piece of the puzzle that facilitate the movement of capital. Different chains are better suited for different uses, and bridges help them become interoperable. Different protocols have different rules and standards, which means tokens you can use on one chain are not usable on another. Bridges allow the use of tokens on new chains. This is achieved via \u2018wrapping\u2019, where a token is burned or locked in escrow on one chain, and an equivalent, \u2018wrapped\u2019 token is issued on the new chain.\n\nThus, if Bob has 10 tokens on the blue blockchain and wishes to move three to the red blockchain, he can lock three of the tokens on the blue blockchain and mint three wrapped tokens on the red blockchain. Bob still has 10 tokens; it's just that three are now wrapped and can be used in a new environment.\n\nHarmoniously Bridging BTC\n\nThe Harmony BTC bridge enables the wrapping of BTC for use on the EVM-compatible Harmony blockchain. Bridging Bitcoin and Harmony has potentially significant implications for the Harmony ecosystem: BTC is a massive asset, with an average market cap of just under $1 trillion over the last six months. If it can be deployed on another chain for yield and other uses, it may mean considerable increases in TVL and network activity.\n\nActivity and use of blockchains is the whole raison d\u2019etre after all; increased usage and the growth of the network is therefore a tremendous victory for any protocol.\n\nAt the time of writing, Harmony TVL stands at over a billion in USD terms. The ability to bridge over an asset worth ~$1 trillion could substantially increase TVL and the value of the Harmony network.\n\nWhat must be mentioned is that a secure bridge to Harmony is a win for all EVM chains and BTC holders. The use of the Ethereum Virtual Machine is, in effect, a standard that many different chains use. This universality dramatically reduces the complexity of using bitcoin on other EVM chains, as sharing standards make bridging tokens easier.\n\nSubsequently, bitcoin hodlers may also benefit from opportunities that lie beyond Harmony, exploring pastures anew on other chains as well.\n\nOne of the main reasons bitcoin hodlers may not wish to use BTC anywhere else is because they do not wish to take on any counterparty risk, and many existing bridges do not operate in a truly trustless way. After all, one of the main theses behind the creation of Bitcoin is the elimination of trust and reliance on third parties. Trustless bridges aim to eliminate these concerns and enable the use of BTC in smart contracts without sacrificing any of the decentralized cypherpunk ethos.\n\nOn paper, the economic incentives of the Harmony BTC bridge do mean it is trustless. Should this be achieved in practice as well as theory, this bridge could be the decentralized gateway for BTC into the EVM world.\n\nAccording to DeFiPulse, the only trustless BTC bridge is tBTC. However, of the ~330,000 BTC deployed on other chains, 79% is done through the custodial wBTC.\n\nSource: DeFi Pulse\n\nThe caveat is that representing this data depends upon an awareness of all active BTC bridges and discerning which UTXOs are locked in various vaults or pools to back bridged coins. However, this is not always possible, as represented by Shinobi, the bridge to Secret Network. The actual number of BTC active on other chains may be higher than reported.\n\nSince bitcoin can be deployed on Harmony, many users may be attracted as the Big Orange Coin can now be deployed for yield on various DeFi protocols.\n\nWhen on Harmony, BTC is represented as 1BTC.\n\nThey are not inherently of equal value. No algorithmic price peg is used; it is simply a supply peg. This means that BTC can always be redeemed 1:1 with 1BTC (plus fees) and vice versa regardless of any price premiums. Thus, game theory dictates that the market will keep the peg by arbitraging any differences.\n\nHow Does the Bridge Work?\n\nOn a very high level, BTC on the Bitcoin blockchain is first locked in a vault. This transaction is verified in a trustless manner through a relayer and enables the minting of 1BTC on the Harmony blockchain. On the way back, the 1BTC is burned - which is verified and gives the right to redeem the originally locked BTC from the vault on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nThe XCLAIM protocol is used as a framework for the bridge. It is a protocol that defines functions for wrapped tokens backed by assets on the original chain. Further information on the protocol and its inner workings can be found here.\n\nIn more depth, when BTC is being bridged, it is locked in vaults on the Bitcoin blockchain. Coins are stored until being redeemed. Thus, they act as backing for the newly issued 1BTC and give it its value.\n\nAnyone is supposed to be able to operate a vault should they wish: the process involves registering the vault and running a vault client. This is designed to be easy and profitable to attract more vaults and improve decentralization.\n\nIn order for the bridge to be trustless, the vault operators are required to post collateral in the form of ONE tokens - the collateral required is currently 150%. This ensures that they have a strong enough disincentive to run away with the BTC. If BTC is spent without authorization, or the vault goes offline and cannot provide service temporarily, punishments are enacted.\n\nRelayers monitor the vaults to see if any unauthorized transactions take place. They also monitor the Bitcoin blockchain for proof that UTXOs have been locked in a vault. They store BTC block headers on Harmony and enable the 1BTC issuing contract to see whether an issuer has made the transaction they claim to have made on the BTC blockchain. Relayers, like Vaults, must post collateral in ONE that is liable to be slashed in the event of malicious behavior.\n\nFees are paid to both of these types of actors to incentivize participation from a network of actors to avoid having just one Relayer and Vault operated by the Harmony team. Trustlessness may only be achieved through decentralization after all.\n\nAn oracle is used to determine the price of ONE relative to BTC. This is how the 150% collateral required is monitored. Currently, this source of information is the only component that is not decentralized - the bridge assumes that the oracle is trustworthy. However, the Chainlink integration is now implemented, and the source of price feeds will now be as decentralized as the Chainlink network.\n\nAccording to the Harmony team, further steps are being taken to mitigate price feed risk. The staked relayers can also submit price feeds used to benchmark the oracle price and determine whether there is a difference between them that is greater than 0.5%. If price fluctuations between two price feeds are greater than 10%, additional measures are taken.\n\nDescribing the bridge with a practical example:\n\nBob wishes to use his BTC for yield farming on the Harmony blockchain.\n\nBob selects a vault, sends his BTC to it, and includes his Harmony address.\nOnce this transaction is verified, a relayer submits proof of inclusion in the Bitcoin block to the Harmony chain.\nThis proof allows Bob to mint 1BTC, which is sent to the Harmony address he submitted with the BTC transaction.\nBob can now use his newly issued 1BTC to get some fat, juicy yields.\n\nThe Economics\n\nIf vaults go offline or fail to provide users service, they are slashed between 10% and 30%. The severity of the punishment is determined by each actor's score, or SLA (Service Level Agreements). The SLA is a number between 0 and 100. The score is increased by good behaviors and service and reduced by subpar performance and crashes. The higher score a vault has, the higher rewards it receives, and the less it is penalized if it fails to provide service. Both Vaults and Relayers have SLAs.\n\nThe reasoning for this is because extreme punishments for first-time offenders may deter actors from participating as vaults. Hence this reputation system is used to give vault operators a history and credibility they can use to escape hefty fines should they fail for any reason beyond their control.\u00a0 If Vaults fail to provide adequate service, their collateral is awarded to the depositor who has lost their BTC. If Relayers are slashed, the tokens are sent to the fee pool.\n\nThese fees are distributed to incentivize the vault operators and Staked Relayers to provide this essential service that allows the bridge to operate in a trustless manner.\n\nSource: BTC Bridge Specs - Fee Model\n\nUsers pay a fee of 0.5% for using the bridge and minting/redeeming 1BTC - paid in 1BTC. These fees are paid to fee pools, and distributed across Relayers and Vaults according to their SLA. Furthermore, direct fees are paid to Vaults and Relayers directly for their service. There is also a security deposit paid, regardless of the amount bridged, that is equal to 0.5% of the amount of collateral required to back the requested BTC transfer. In addition, all slashed stakes (penalties for downtime/bad service) are also sent to these pools.\n\nEssentially, using a permissionless network of vaults and relayers means that the bridge can operate in a truly censorship-resistant way. The fee model is the final puzzle piece that makes the bridge work. If all stakeholders act in a game-theoretic way, and if there are enough stakeholders to make it sybil resistant: the bridge functions.\n\nFuture Plans\n\nAs with many projects, certain aspects of the project are fixed initially, and the team reserves control over them to remain agile and make quick decisions. Future plans and developments revolve around the economics and the governance and control of the bridge.\n\nEconomics\n\nThe current security deposit fee for locking BTC in a vault is a single ONE token. This could change to be a percentage of the vault\u2019s collateral.\nMove to a fee market instead of the fixed 0.5% minting and redeeming fees.\n\nGovernance\n\nThere are plans to introduce a token in a future release.\nThis will likely be used for decentralized governance of the bridge and its specs/fees.\nThe release of a token will also probably lead to revised tokeneconomics.\n\nRisks\n\nAs laid forth in an excellent medium article by Dmitriy Berenzon: there are three main categories of bridges. Any given bridge can fall into one of the classifications or combine elements of each.\n\nSource: Dmitriy Berenzon\n\nThe 1BTC bridge is one of light clients and relays. As can be seen on the above graph, it excels in capital efficiency, statefulness, and security. The economic incentives of the bridge ensure that the federation of Staked Relayers maintains connectivity and statefulness. In addition, Vaults are incentivized to provide timely service.\n\nHowever, two areas of weakness are capital (in)efficiency and security.\n\nCapital Efficiency\n\nThe staked tokens by Relayers and Vaults and the BTC collateral posted by users is just that: fixed capital that sits there hostage to disincentivize antisocial behavior. Although a robust mechanism that aligns incentives, this capital is not used for liquidity or put to work in any way.\n\nCapital inefficiency is not a sin per se; it just means that the utilization of resources could be more efficient. In addition to that, it could hamper scalability, as collateral must increase proportionally with value bridged. Since collateral required to bridge BTC is 150%, the amount held in vaults must always be 10% greater than 1BTC in existence. Of course, these are design tradeoffs made in the name of speed and aligned economic incentives.\n\nSecurity\n\nA chain is only as strong as its weakest link. In the world of crypto and blockchain, this usually translates to the layer of the stack that is most centralized. In the case of the bridge, it is the reliance on the price oracle whose trustworthiness is assumed.\n\nThis oracle dictates the price of ONE/BTC. Since ONE is the collateral used by Vaults and Relayers, the price dropping below a certain threshold relative to BTC can trigger liquidations/slashing. Theoretically, should the oracle be manipulated (a common exploit) to give false prices, these conditions may be falsely met.\n\nChainlink Oracles have now been integrated and will provide a price feed not dependent upon a single oracle. Thus the oracle risk will be mitigated by making this link of the chain as censorship resistant as Chainlink\u2019s network.\n\nConcluding Remarks: Chains Existing in Harmony\n\nUltimately, the Harmony BTC bridge uses a network of vaults and relayers. The architecture is decentralized in theory, but it is yet to be seen whether the existing incentives are enough to galvanize different actors into participation to achieve decentralization.\n\nThe merits, as well as the risks of the design, have been examined, and the undeniable importance of bridges mentioned. The multi-chain world is not an idea; it is a reality. Different chains are optimized for different purposes. Numerous blockchains today boast impressive activity and value locked. However, issues arise due to clashing ideologies, standards, and the fragmentation of liquidity and information.\n\nThe future of dapps and UX is not one where users manually select which chain to transact on; it is one where users are unaware of which underlying blockchain is being used to interact with Web3. Users may even be using multiple simultaneously - one for verification, another to sign transactions, and yet another for settlement with finality.\n\nFrictionless bridges and communication between blockchains can enable this vision of the not-so-distant future. The continuing development and decentralization of these services are vital to an internet run on blockchains. The new Harmony-Bitcoin bridge is another step towards this future, where information and value are seamlessly and trustlessly interoperable across chains.\n\nThis report was commissioned by Harmony, a member of Protocol Services.

Polygon offers developer training, partnerships with premier universities like IITs, and hackathons to grow the developer talent base and incubate high-quality Web3 startups in India and abroad.\n\nCrypto made big strides these last two years. In the summer of 2020, DeFi primitives gained prominence in what became known as \u201cDeFi Summer.\u201d The following year, NFTs became popular \u2013 first as profile pictures, then as community tokens, and now with revenue-generating use cases such as music and gaming, among others.\n\nNaturally, the growing interest behind blockchain corresponded with a surge in users. Total value locked (TVL) on smart contract networks rose from $500 million since the start of the pandemic to $170 billion two years later. Even more, with further interest in the metaverse, ownership of assets, and banking the unbanked, crypto\u2019s growth is only expected to continue.\n\nThough investors all benefit from crypto\u2019s maturation, the expansion of the industry hasn\u2019t come without growing pain. Quite infamously, the current blockchain infrastructure struggles to support the rise in users. Transaction throughput has slowed, and network fees have spiked. Ethereum in particular struggles to handle the transaction load submitted to its blockchain. According to Etherscan, average gas costs jumped from 10 gwei in March 2020 to 60 gwei two years later \u2013 without accounting for stretches in 2021 when gas consistently hovered around 150 or even 200 gwei, highlighting the need for improved infrastructure.\n\nThus, an emerging consensus we\u2019re seeing amongst investors is the need for a cross-chain ecosystem. In other words, one monolithic blockchain may not be enough to support everything users need. By distributing the work across multiple entities, the total work required from one singular blockchain would diminish. If investors are right, building a cross-chain world is the way to achieve the type of scale needed to onboard the first billion users.\n\nThis report will highlight a major component of Ethereum\u2019s cross-chain scaling effort: Polygon Technology. Key sections of this report include an overview of the company, a short introduction to ZK Rollups, Polygon\u2019s ecosystem of projects, and the company\u2019s upcoming roadmap.\n\nA Multi-Chain Ethereum World\n\nPolygon Technology, widely known just as Polygon, is building a collection of platforms for blockchain infrastructure \u2013 specifically, for the Ethereum ecosystem. Its products are designed to support the growth of Ethereum as the network ramps up its user and application base. It\u2019s worth noting, Polygon\u2019s particular focus on Ethereum reflects the company\u2019s core belief in the network as the center of the future cross-chain paradigm.\n\nFrom a bigger picture, Polygon competes in what we should call the blockchain-as-a-service industry. Alongside competitors like Starkware, Arbitrum, Loopring, and Matter Labs, these startups create solutions designed to enhance blockchain scalability through increased network throughput and reduced transaction costs.\n\nAt present, blockchain scaling lacks a one-size-fit-all answer, meaning each startup\u2019s solution \u2013 be it Optimistic rollups, Zero Knowledge rollups (ZK Rollups), or some other alternative \u2013 has a place in the current ecosystem. This sort of competitive research effort is what Mihailo Bjelic, co-founder of Polygon, has referred to in the past as \u201cletting one thousand flowers bloom.\u201d\n\nPolygon started in 2018 as a joint effort between Bjelic \u2013 who was experimenting with Plasma rollups \u2013 and Jaynti Kanani, Sandeep Nailwal, and Anurag Arjun, the three of whom had been working on another scaling blockchain, Matic Network. At that time, the joint entity combined with a few products under its belt: (1) The blockchain SDK development framework developed by Bjelic and (2) the Plasma rollup and Matic sidechain, powered by the MATIC token. Unfortunately, blockchain researchers discovered the data availability problem shortly thereafter (discussed further in the report), leading to Plasma being deprecated for other solutions. The resulting period of time left the team focused on the Matic sidechain, the SDK framework (later renamed to Edge), and in search of next steps.\n\nAround February 2021, the team announced the rebrand from Matic Network to its current Polygon name and announced its strategy to become a cross-chain Hub for Ethereum. Its new goal would be to function as a company for a host of multichain services. Offering an emerging suite of products would become the new focus for the company, starting with the user-facing product that had survived since the beginning: Matic Network, now rebranded to Polygon Proof-of-Stake (PoS).\n\nPolygon PoS Sidechain: The First Product\n\nUsers may already be familiar with Polygon PoS. The sidechain has been around for close to two years. It launched just before DeFi Summer and took full advantage of the opportunity in May 2021 when curiosity around decentralized apps exploded.\n\nMuch has been made about Polygon PoS\u2019s technical classification given the company\u2019s efforts around Layer-2 scaling. We think it\u2019s an important distinction to qualify that the current iteration of the PoS Chain is a Layer-1 sidechain, largely attributing to the network not inheriting security from Ethereum nodes and having its own set of validators. Regardless, for users seeking affordable transaction costs, this EVM-compatible network is an option worth exploring; in fact, many of Ethereum's most popular DeFi platforms such as Aave, Curve, and Uniswap provide their services on the PoS Chain at a fraction of the gas cost required by Ethereum.\n\nThe chart above highlights the difference in average transaction costs between Polygon PoS and Ethereum. The data presented is striking. Average costs are only fractions of a dollar on Polygon PoS whereas users are frequently paying $20 or more on Ethereum. If we assume every transaction completed on PoS Chain in the past year was instead made on Ethereum, users would have paid almost $15 billion more in total transaction costs.\n\nNow, it\u2019s important to know this data is skewed by the lower price of MATIC relative to ETH. If the costs presented are adjusted to USD, the absolute cost on PoS Chain is lower than on Ethereum, but measured in gas prices, differences are not stark. Nonetheless, PoS Chain still represents a great option for users wanting to avoid the costs of Ethereum today. And it is a big reason why the sidechain processes more daily transactions than Ethereum \u2013 including hitting a peak 4x more than Ethereum \u2013 and has attracted 100+ million wallets to date.\n\nReaching these numbers is a milestone in itself, but one could argue it\u2019s just an appetizer for Polygon\u2019s larger aspirations. As we saw above, sidechains don\u2019t level up blockchain scaling as well as Layer-2 solutions like rollups. That\u2019s why Polygon is devoting its resources to Layer-2 scaling and ZK Rollups \u2013 to find solutions to improve throughput and reduce the amount of gas needed to make transactions. The thesis strikes a chord across the industry as leading tech and crypto-native investors alike have chosen to grab a seat at the table. In fact, notable names such as Sequoia Capital India, Andreeson Horowitz, Tiger Global, Union Square Ventures, Galaxy Digital, and others have backed the company, signaling faith in the team and alignment with the company\u2019s vision.\n\nPolygon\u2019s roadmap includes the development of the company\u2019s seven product solutions, ranging from the aforementioned PoS sidechain, to L2 Rollups, and to other blockchain infrastructure. In total, Polygon is committing more than $1 billion to acquire promising projects, invest in research, and create an Ethereum scaling ecosystem. Since a significant part of Polygon\u2019s future incorporates ZK technology, it\u2019s important to first understand how it works before getting to the rest of the report.\n\nA Brief Primer to Zero Knowledge Rollups\n\nZK Rollups are one of the two general categories of Layer-2 rollups, alongside their peer, Optimistic rollups. At its core, the idea of ZK Rollups relies on cryptographic proofs to verify changes to the network state before they are bundled into the Ethereum blockchain. As a result, some call ZK Rollups \u2018validity proofs\u2019. This stands in contrast to Optimistic rollups, which \u201coptimistically\u201d assume all transactions are correct and let verifiers on the mainnet check for fraudulent transactions over some course of time. Optimistic rollups are also referred to as \u2018fraud proofs\u2019.\n\nLet\u2019s get a little deeper behind ZK Rollups and see why they\u2019re promising. The basic premise behind ZK Rollups is to have third-party operators batch transactions together instead of verifying each individually \u2013 hence the \u201crolling up\u201d taxonomy \u2013 to increase the total processing capacity of the network. State changes to the blockchain are submitted in the form of ZK Proofs for the verifier on the mainnet to check. The verifier can be convinced of the validity of all the submitted transactions through the proof without \u2013 due to the zero knowledge feature \u2013 having to run each individual transaction.\n\nAn important part of this process is the soundness property of proofs, which ensures malicious provers are unable to deceive verifiers with false statements. Extrapolating this property for rollups is simple: all batched transactions must be valid if they are to be accepted onto the blockchain. And since zero knowledge of each transaction is required by the mainnet for validation, little interaction between the two chains is needed, making gas fees cheaper and the overall rollup scaling easier.\n\nAnother core advantage of ZK Rollups is the network\u2019s ability to validate transactions immediately. Automatic verification leads to numerous benefits for the user. The simplest is the ability to move capital from the rollup chain to the mainnet right away, without needing to wait for others to check for fraudulent data, as is the case when using Optimistic rollups.\n\nThe technology behind ZK Rollups is promising, but for total fairness, it\u2019s also worth mentioning that ZK Rollups have, to this point, not lived up to expectations. This is an important caveat based on the fact no ZK Rollup to date has launched with full EVM-compatibility on Ethereum\u2019s mainnet. That\u2019s why almost all active rollups to date use fraud proofs. However, several research initiatives are close, with a few operating on testnet in H1 2022, including those owned by Polygon. At the risk of sounding like a broken record, it does seem like the much-awaited day is close.\n\nPolygon\u2019s Product Stack\n\nPolygon\u2019s suite of products includes the aforementioned PoS sidechain and six ZK-supported projects. Out of those six, three of them (Hermez, Miden, and Zero) are direct ZK Rollups, another (Nightfall) is a privacy-enabling Optimistic rollup with ZK cryptography, while the remaining two (Avail and Edge) are designed to help build ZK and modular infrastructure. The graphic below lists the full product suite and classifies each in relation to shared Ethereum security. Low security products are akin to standalone chains with independent validators while high shared security products are full Layer-2 rollups entirely dependent on Ethereum. In the next section, we will run through each of the products, starting with the four ZK Rollups.\n\nPolygon Hermez: Decentralized and Active\n\nIn August 2021, Polygon announced it acquired Hermez for $250 million in one of the largest blockchain network M&A deals to date. The transaction was financed through Polygon\u2019s native MATIC tokens from the company\u2019s token treasury. Previous holders of Hermez\u2019s native token (HEZ) were able to redeem their tokens for MATIC at a rate of 3.5 MATIC tokens to 1 HEZ token. The outcome of the acquisition meant Polygon was in charge of the new resulting entity, Polygon Hermez.\n\nOf the four ZK Rollups in Polygon\u2019s suite, Polygon Hermez is the furthest along in use. It\u2019s the first open-source decentralized ZK Rollup to operate on top of Ethereum\u2019s mainnet \u2013 albeit without ZK EVM compatibility \u2013 and has been available to the public since March 2021. Users deploy funds to the rollup network where they can be quickly and cheaply sent between wallets as transfers and payments. Polygon Hermez is able to process up to 2,000 transactions per second, a number that\u2019s expected to rise even higher as Ethereum implements sharding sometime in 2023 after The Merge. Regardless, the end result today is still a more than 90% reduction in transaction costs compared to typical mainnet gas fees.\n\nSource: Polygon Hermez\n\nAs with each of Polygon\u2019s other ZK Rollup products, Hermez has its own research focus. Hermez places a high emphasis on decentralization. It is the only active Layer-2 without a need for a centralized operator. While the use of decentralized sequencers seems trivial, particularly in the early innings of ZK Rollups, the long-term effects could be significant. As cited by the Polygon team, a switch from centralized to decentralized operators may be operationally and technologically challenging down the road, giving Polygon Hermez a head start relative to its competition.\n\nWhat lies ahead for Polygon Hermez is the launch of Polygon Hermez 2.0, a future iteration combining the existing ZK Rollup with an implementation of a ZK EVM. The need for the latter is crucial for scaling Ethereum as non-ZK EVM rollups can only handle token payments and token transfers. A ZK EVM-enabled blockchain will allow the network to handle smart contracts directly on the rollup and open up another avenue of innovation. The final product is expected to closely emulate the 50 - 70 instruction codes available on the original EVM. This decision to stick with similar machine language opcodes allows engineers to port existing applications to the rollup or easily create new ones if needed.\n\nA testnet release is expected sometime in the next three months (Q2 2022). Once testing is over, a full launch of Polygon Hermez 2.0 is anticipated to arrive sometime the following quarter. Should that timeline hold, ZK Rollup enthusiasts will get the opportunity to see this scaling option take shape.\n\nPolygon Zero: Need for Speed\n\nPolygon Zero began as Mir Protocol, a project for decentralized applications powered by recursive ZK Proofs. In December 2021, Polygon announced an acquihire of the Mir Protocol team, seeking to combine synergies between the Mir project and the rest of Polygon\u2019s tech stack. The deal was even larger than the Hermez one. It was announced at around $400mm and financed through a combination of cash and Polygon\u2019s MATIC token.\n\nAs part of the Polygon ecosystem, the Mir team\u2019s goal remains the same: to build the world\u2019s fastest ZK Rollup. Unlike Polygon Hermez \u2013 which devotes the majority of research resources towards decentralization\u00a0 \u2013 Polygon Zero\u2019s target is speed. The optimal solution discovered so far is through scalable ZK-SNARKs, otherwise known as recursive proofs.\n\nRecursive ZK Proofs speed things up by increasing the number of transactions that can be processed at any one time. We can do a comparison here: Existing ZK Rollups often take significant computing resources to generate a proof for batches with a large number of transactions; this is true for ZK Rollups that need to support general-use applications and even more true for those that are slowed down by a need for EVM-compatibility. In contrast, efficient recursive ZK Proofs allow for the distribution of processing into more manageable, concurrent chunks of work. Once each transaction has been verified, a recursive algorithm goes through and aggregates all the proofs until they eventually settle into one proof. The best way to imagine this is using a pyramid shape where the base layer represents all the transactions. As each transaction gets proved, it gets sent upwards until they all culminate at the top. The final proof can be sent to the mainnet at a quicker and more cost-effective rate than current alternatives.\n\nPolygon Zero is able to do this through Plonky2, a recursive ZK Proof generator capable of generating a SNARK proof every 0.17 seconds, making Plonky2 the world\u2019s fastest recursive ZK prover.\n\nInventing this technology has taken years of research. Practical applications behind recursive ZK Proofs only started in 2014. In 2019, two minutes were needed to generate each recursive proof. The slow proof generation clearly rendered the technology useless for blockchain scaling. In 2020, the development of Plonky, combined with a few other techniques, reduced that time to 15 seconds. Plonky2 brought the time down even further to 170 milliseconds, making it the world\u2019s fastest recursive ZK prover.\n\nThat said, further research is needed before Plonky2 goes live. Timelines are yet to be announced, but further information will be provided by the Polygon team as additional prover breakthroughs occur.\n\nPolygon Miden: STARKs not SNARKs\n\nThe next ZK Rollup in Polygon\u2019s arsenal is Miden. Unlike most ZK Rollups, which use ZK-SNARKs, Miden utilizes another proof called ZK-STARKs. STARK stands for \u201cscalable transparent argument of knowledge\u201d while SNARK stands for \u201csuccinct non-interactive argument of knowledge.\u201d It should not be surprising then to learn SNARKs and STARKs share similarities given how closely their names align. At their core, they both function as a privacy and scaling technology, providing applications with the ability to verify proofs at a more secure, faster rate.\n\nWhere they differ is in the details. STARKs traditionally do not require an initial setup process between the prover and validator, though some modern SNARKs have found ways to remove this process as well. What SNARK hasn\u2019t matched is the ability to respond to the threat of quantum computing: SNARKs are vulnerable to quantum computing whereas the leaner cryptographic functions used by STARKs are provably post-quantum secure.\n\nThe tradeoff for using STARKS is the need for a larger proof, resulting in higher gas costs and lack of recursion. Implementing the latter may be possible but it is unproven for the time being. Additional research of both SNARKs and STARKs will continue to open new doors for Layer-2 proofs.\n\nAs the graphic below shows, the transaction rollup procedure is similar to the traditional ZK Rollup with the usual SNARKs replaced with STARKs.\n\nSource: Polygon Miden\n\nMiden\u2019s advantage lies in the creation of Miden VM, a ZK-STARK compatible with EVM. Miden VM is a general-purpose ZK Virtual Machine, which lets developers utilize the full Turing completeness capability of the platform. In addition, multi-language support is offered for developers. These languages, including Solidity, Move, and Vyper, are compiled into Miden Assembly Language to be read by the VM.\n\nMiden VM\u2019s evolution began in 2019 as a library called genSTARK, which allowed developers to create simple STARK provers. Continued improvements, such as full Turing completeness, took shape with Distaff VM (early generation STARK-based VM) and Winterfell (upgraded iteration of genSTARK). The current iteration of Miden VM, a public v0.1 prototype, combines features from both Distaff VM and Winterfell and was launched in November 2021. Developers interested in building with the new virtual machine are able to experiment with the product\u2019s features. A v0.2 prototype is anticipated to be released in Q2 2022. Testnet development should take the project through the end of the year, after which a mainnet deployment is expected to occur sometime in 2023.\n\nPolygon Nightfall: Privacy for Enterprises\n\nAs mentioned in the ZK Rollup introduction, ZK Rollups do not, by default, offer privacy from prying eyes. That\u2019s where Polygon Nightfall comes in. Nightfall is an Optimistic rollup enhanced by the privacy benefits of ZK cryptography. Here, the type of ZK cryptography used in Nightfall differs slightly from generic ZK Rollups; the former is used to foster data privacy while the latter is used for transaction verification. The idea behind the pairing of ZK cryptography with a fraud proof rollup originated from the need to service enterprises with a differentiated product, one that kept the privacy elements of ZK cryptography while maintaining low transaction costs.\n\nNightfall was originally created in 2019 by EY, the Big 4 professional services firm, as a way to conduct private transactions on Ethereum. This was a big milestone as it marked the first time a large enterprise got actively involved with Ethereum\u2019s development. As demand for privacy-secure blockchains increased in the years since, EY began to look for partners to help scale the offering. What occurred as a result became Polygon Nightfall, a collaboration between EY and Polygon to create a public-facing privacy-focused rollup, making it an ideal option for enterprises.\n\nCorporate transactions and operational tools benefit the most from this type of privacy feature. Nightfall will also be legally and KYC-compliant. The goal of the partnership is to create a whitelist of companies who can access the network; when a business makes a transaction, a proof will need to be provided confirming access before the privacy-secure transaction gets completed.\n\nEY\u2019s corporate clients can already connect to Polygon Nightfall through an EY front-end portal. Nightfall is currently exploring further ways to scale the product. No specific timelines have been set for the roadmap, but both EY and Polygon have aspirations to continue their partnership for other enterprise-specific blockchains.\n\nPolygon Avail: Data Availability for Ethereum\n\nPolygon Avail is the first of Polygon\u2019s two architectural products. Avail seeks to address the challenges nodes face when processing malicious or incomplete data. In the blockchain world, these challenges are referred to as the data availability problem, which was the problem mentioned above that caused researchers to sunset Plasma rollup initiatives. Common situations where this problem occurs include when nodes accept blocks where data is incomplete or when nodes are unable to validate the accuracy of transaction data in the network (i.e., blockchain censorship).\n\nPolygon describes Avail as the solution to this problem across the multi-chain Ethereum ecosystem. Avail is a data availability-specific blockchain designed for standalone chains, sidechains, and other scaling technologies \u2013 meaning the entirety of the Avail chain is purposed to store Ethereum \u2018calldata\u2019 tracking changes to the Ethereum state machine. No smart contracts are intended to be deployed on Avail, and no applications can be built on Avail either. Rather, the entire purpose of Avail\u2019s existence is to sequence and store data in order to ensure data remains accessible by a sampling process conducted by light client nodes.\n\nSource: Polygon Avail\n\nCompared to current blockchain architecture, the Avail network will focus on ensuring full transaction data is posted rather than verifying state changes. Unlike full nodes, light nodes do not download the entire block data but instead prioritize sampling a random group of data from each block to evaluate for completeness. This process is known as a data availability check. It\u2019s a technique shared by other data availability platforms and can be completed at a constant resource cost, regardless of data scale.\n\nIn its final form, Polygon envisions a scenario where developers might create their own standalone PoS chain and outsource network security to Avail. Operators on the standalone chain would send the transactions to Avail for ordering and storage. This helps immediately bootstrap network security since complete transaction data is held off-chain for easy access.\n\nAvail currently remains in development with no key roadmap dates yet announced by the Polygon team.\n\nPolygon Edge: Made With Developers in Mind\n\nPreviously known as Polygon SDK, Polygon Edge is an open-source modular blockchain development framework built for engineers who want to create their own blockchains. The framework allows for the creation of both secured chains (Layer-2 blockchains) and standalone Ethereum sidechains.\n\nBoth options have their respective advantages. Secured chains offer two unique features: easy bootstrapping for those with limited resources and enhanced security on a layer separate from the mainnet. New crypto protocols without the resources to bootstrap security or enterprises looking to enhance transaction throughput on their own network may want to utilize the Edge framework to build secured chains. Meanwhile, sidechains require their own validator set, making it a good fit for enterprises looking to maximize independence or for community-based networks capable of supporting their own decentralized blockchain.\n\nSource: Polygon Edge\n\nThe diagram above represents the various components of the development framework. Each component, including known modules such as blockchains and consensus, and more obscure modules, such as\u00a0 Libp2p, GPRC, and JSON RPC, represents functions within the technical architecture. Developers are able to modify these modules to suit their needs, combining them like building blocks to make up the network. Polygon Edge supports both Proof-of-Stake and Proof-of-Authority as consensus algorithms.\n\nRollout of Edge for the standalone chain framework began in May 2021. The second iteration of the framework for secured chains is expected to follow shortly. Aligning closely with Polygon\u2019s thesis of a more advanced multi-chain Ethereum ecosystem, products such as Polygon Edge help solve a pressing need regarding L2 communication and ease of project deployment.\n\nPolygon Corporate Funds\n\nAs mentioned prior, the company also actively encourages protocols to use Polygon-enabled networks. Direct mandates include investing in founder teams, providing support for project token economics, staking, governance, and leveraging the Polygon network for marketing initiatives.\n\nEcosystem Partnerships\n\nOne strategic endeavor is to partner with active venture investors within the crypto community. Polygon maintains relationships with four organizations, though the company does not have the decision-making authority to invest capital.\n\nPolygon x Wintermute: Partnership with a $20 million fund to support project liquidity, business development, and token exchange listing purposes\nPolygon x 776: Collaboration with a $200 million general-purpose fund investing in Web3 and other crypto-native applications\nPolygon x Outlier Ventures: Polygon-based accelerator designed to foster mentorship and collaboration with the venture team at Outlier Ventures\nPolygon x StableNode: Partnership with a blockchain node management operator experienced in providing hands-on services such as staking, governance, and more\n\nPolygon Ecosystem Fund\n\nThe company\u2019s final corporate development team is its Ecosystem Fund. Unlike the partnerships mentioned above, the Ecosystem Fund is Polygon\u2019s own internal investment fund. Capital allocation decisions are strategically designed to boost the adoption of Polygon\u2019s blockchains.\n\nThe $100 million Ecosystem Fund manages all of Polygon\u2019s corporate investments. This includes joint investments with the Polygon Studios team below. So far, $15 million from the fund has been deployed across 50 global projects. The team is still actively searching for investment opportunities.\n\nPolygon Studios\n\nIn summer 2021, Polygon launched Polygon Studios, its internal unit aimed at drawing existing gamers toward blockchain games. Polygon Studios collaborates with ambitious NFT projects and marketplaces to scale user bases across a low-cost platform.\n\nMore than 100,000 gamers and over 500 apps are already onboarded. The team has announced partnerships with both crypto-native projects such as The Sandbox, Decentraland, and OpenSea, along with traditional entertainment brands such as DraftKings, Electronic Arts, and Atari. Capital from the Ecosystem Fund will also be used to make investments in projects beneficial to the company\u2019s NFT/gaming initiatives.\n\nTasked with heading Polygon Studios is Ryan Wyatt, who left his previous role at Google where he served as both the Head of Gaming Partnerships at Google and Head of Gaming at YouTube. Wyatt started his career in professional esports as a gaming commentator, making him uniquely qualified to lead the Polygon Studios effort.\n\nLeadership within the Community\n\nAside from its prominent reputation in the global crypto community, it\u2019s important to also focus on Polygon\u2019s role in the crypto community in India. The company\u2019s status as an Indian-based startup unicorn has helped validate the industry in the eyes of skeptics and encouraged more of the nation\u2019s youth to experiment with crypto. This form of leadership by example has been particularly beneficial to the country\u2019s burgeoning ecosystem given the Indian government\u2019s hot-cold relationship with the industry.\n\nPolygon has also taken an active role in investing in its community. Polygon frequently sponsors, mentors, and judges hackathons in India. It was heavily involved with ETHIndia. In addition, the company also partners with students by offering smart contract application engineering courses and working with blockchain clubs at several of the IIT institutions, IT Mumbai, and other select Indian universities.\n\nTo showcase where Polygon stands as a financial platform, we can benchmark the company\u2019s valuation against the largest Indian banks. By this methodology, Polygon would rank as the seventh-largest financial institution. Of course, there are some major caveats with this type of analysis. For one, Polygon doesn\u2019t offer direct financial services and operates more as a financial payments platform. Moreover, the startup\u2019s ecosystem includes indirect financial use cases such as NFTs and blockchain gaming. That said, this quick-and-easy comparison does highlight how rapidly Polygon has risen and the level of expectations investors have placed on the company moving forward.\n\nRoadmap\n\nMuch of the Polygon\u2019s team\u2019s focus for the upcoming year is corporate, not technological, which could signal how comfortable the team is with the state of its product suite. As each product continues to research, test, or launch its own scaling solution, more emphasis will be placed on finding the right partners and protocols to integrate into Polygon\u2019s network of offerings.\n\nIn public interviews, Polygon has expressed interest in reorganizing the company\u2019s team structure and expanding partnerships with crypto projects, particularly in the NFT and gaming sector. Headcount growth is also expected to continue with the goal of doubling the number of employees by the end of the year. Though the exact details of each team\u2019s organization are unknown, it\u2019s important to note Polygon wants to centralize key leadership while keeping the decentralized autonomy of each team.\n\nFor investors, one of the most exciting updates will be a token redesign. The current MATIC token is a legacy remnant of the old Matic business and works with Matic\u2019s network, Polygon PoS. The future token will have a new ticker and work across all Polygon products. Given what we know today, use cases may include staking to enhance security or selecting blockchain operators. Interestingly, the token will not be mandatory for all users, meaning it will not be necessary to buy, stake, or hold; for many users, it may just be something in the background. Although the timing is unclear, Bjelic has stated there is a desire to complete the token redesign sometime in 2022.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe next few years will be competitive for blockspace. Winners will be decided by determining which has the best ease of use, transaction speed, and transaction cost. This next stage of blockchain evolution means core infrastructure is now more important than ever. Users around the world need a network capable of rivaling Visa and Mastercard, the type of processing that can handle thousands of transactions per second.\n\nPolygon is striving to meet the demand with its suite of rollup solutions. Its aggressive 2021 growth strategy, by acquiring and onboarding different ZK projects, now ensures Polygon\u2019s portfolio offers something for everyone. If a user is wanting faster or more private transactions, there\u2019s Hermez, Miden, or Zero; if an enterprise is seeking privacy, there\u2019s Nightfall; and if a developer is looking for scaling solutions, Avail reduces the burden of data availability while Edge helps build new blockchains entirely.\n\nThe suite of products gives Polygon a significant moat. As long as it can draw projects to its platform, Polygon will continue to remain a big industry participant for years to come.\n\nThis report was commissioned by Polygon, a member of Protocol Services.
