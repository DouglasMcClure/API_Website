We\u2019ve never been in a weaker position than we are today, and some rapid, proactive moves are needed to survive. We propose a \u201cUser Bill of Rights\u201d and several remedial steps toward self-regulation of the crypto markets.\n\nHaving lived through the 2015 and 2018 bear markets as a full-timer in crypto, market drawdowns don\u2019t usually make me queasy. This time is different.\n\nI\u2019m not worried about my personal portfolio. But I am acutely aware that the world is gawking at the unwinding of a $40 billion algorithmic stablecoin protocol, mere weeks after a $100 million hack / $200 million hack / $600 million hack, not to mention a tax deadline that likely put thousands of speculators net underwater (if not bankrupt) as crypto, NFT, and tech markets crashed and dropped portfolio holdings below many capital gains liabilities.\n\nWe could get [very bad worded] by policymakers as a result.\n\nThe CBDC shillers, Citizen Protectoooors, and regulatory henchmen have an unprecedented amount of ammunition to fire at us at the exact time: a) the country looks for a convenient scapegoat as we enter recession, b) the political winds shift away from some of our allies and in favor of some of our enemies as we approach the midterms (thanks SCOTUS), and c) crypto\u2019s biggest boosters are financially wounded and burnt out from a rollercoaster market cycle.\n\nThe time has come to be proactive about basic self-regulatory and consumer protection measures, while aggressively defending basic crypto user rights. We can acknowledge crypto\u2019s risks and shortcomings without conceding an inch on the right to code new protocols, self-custody assets, or transact on p2p networks.\n\nLet\u2019s also be honest: an earnest discussion of user rights has been largely absent from the institution-led policy discussions so far. That\u2019s a shame because there are three popular, populist arguments for crypto that hold regardless of market conditions. Now more than ever, we need to lean into them:\n\nTrust in institutions is declining and crypto networks present a credible alternative to centralized monopolies. Progress is messy, but we have a right to explore alternatives.\nWe also have a Constitutional right to financial privacy (4th amendment) and peer-to-peer transactions (1st and 4th). The right to own personal wallets is inviolable.\nCommunity-owned protocols offer better economics, upside, and user rights than tech monopolies, even if they come with new risks that reflect their early stage.\n\nCrypto\u2019s institutions (the exchanges and VCs mostly) may already be pushing these arguments with policy makers, even if they use slightly different words. But I worry these words sound empty if they aren\u2019t supplemented by a groundswell of user feedback to policymakers. Do you, the users, prefer protection from crypto protocols, or from government overreach?\n\nIf the latter, let\u2019s push policymakers to make a simple two line commitment to crypto, while we crowdsource a proper user bill of rights.\n\nSomething like this:\n\nI, _____, am committed to safeguarding crypto innovation in the United States, and will:\n\n1. Oppose any and all efforts to ban or restrict the use or personal possession of Bitcoin and other digital assets in the United States.\n\n2. Oppose any and all efforts to unfairly target or impede the development, accessibility, and security of Bitcoin and other digital asset technologies.\n\nWhile we work towards this\u2026\n\nA \u201cUser Bill of Rights\u201d for Crypto\n\nCongress regularly passes resolutions, which are distinct from bills. Sometimes it\u2019s easier to pass these since they don\u2019t typically have legal significance. Sometimes they are just about constituent issues or expressions of support for random causes.\n\nThe original Bill of Rights was adopted as a joint resolution of Congress.\n\nCould we introduce a Digital Asset (DC\u2019s preferred term) User Bill of Rights as a joint resolution? It might not have legal significance, but it would be a positive and proactive signal that shows policymakers will take property rights seriously even if they regulate crypto\u2019s investors and intermediaries.\n\nA lawmaker\u2019s expression of support for this resolution would be one way to signal that they are pro-crypto, similar to the simple pledge above, and we should see which, if any, members are willing to co-sponsor it. A Digital Asset User Bill of Rights also has better odds of symbolic passage than a comprehensive crypto bill this session (though the latter would be an incredible achievement).\n\nHere\u2019s a first draft that could use work:\n\nThe users of digital asset applications and owners of cryptocurrency and other digital assets, having property rights in their assets protected by the Constitution to the same degree as physical assets, require a commitment from their government to preserve their rights as enumerated in the following Digital Asset User Bill of Rights:\n\nRESOLVED\n\nArticle the first\u2026owners of assets held or controlled privately and in digital form possess the same rights against unlawful search, seizure and warrantless surveillance as physical assets held or secured on private personal property.\n\nArticle the second\u2026users of digital assets that operate outside of the traditional financial system have the right to decide, subject to mutual consent of both parties, when and if to share their personal identity with the entities with whom they transact.\n\nArticle the third\u2026digital asset users and owners have the right to receive equivalent priority from law enforcement agencies in response to cases of fraud and theft against their property interests.\n\nArticle the fourth\u2026digital asset users and owners have the right to a clear financial and consumer regulatory compliance framework that provides the same flexibility and viability as laws that adapted to the creation of the internet and exemptions that facilitate the formation of private capital.\n\nArticle the fifth\u2026digital asset transactions mutually consented to will not be presumed to take place within the United States merely by virtue of the fact that the technology with which they are transmitted or verified are located in the United States.\n\nArticle the sixth\u2026citizens and residents of the United States have the right to transmit value over digital means, both domestically and internationally, without the mandated use of regulated financial institutions.\n\nArticle the seventh\u2026digital asset users and owners have the right to consent to crypto specific risks and the right to rely on the principles of decentralization and trustless blockchain mechanisms as substitutes for intermediary-dependent finance.\n\nArticle the eighth\u2026digital asset users and owners who provide liquidity to applications that do not purport to be federally insured depository institutions or regulated exchanges have the right to maintain those relationships in their current form, without those relationships artificially altered into a regulatory construct of intermediary-dependent regulation\n\nArticle the ninth\u2026digital asset users depend on computer code. The development of the code language on which they depend must be given the same respect as any other expression of speech protected by the first amendment to the Constitution.\n\nArticle the tenth\u2026sharing information with other users about blockchain technology and its potential use will not be presumed a crime, but will instead be presumed a protected act of free speech.\n\nThis covers some positive rights of all crypto users, and defends sacred turf: code is law; your keys / your coins; if you have any questions, get a warrant.\n\nAt the same time, we draw a line in the sand for user rights, the entities within crypto may also have some remedial defensive work to do.  \n\nQuick Wins and Industry Standards\n\nWe founded Messari during the height of the ICO euphoria, after Dan (my-cofounder) and I had been looking at ways to short the entire 2017 house of cards. We even had a name picked out - Icarus Capital - that fit our activist strategy, but we simply didn\u2019t trust the integrity of the reference market data feeds, the exchanges we\u2019d have to use to go short, or the lenders we would need to borrow from. We figured it would be better to focus on building long-term solutions for the industry by fixing its information asymmetry problems.\n\nIn some respects, we are right back to where we started.\n\nFixing information asymmetry problems is the stated objective of both Messari and of the Securities and Exchange Commission. We just happen to disagree on the issue of whether most tokens are securities. And whether it is acceptable to block \u201cretail investors\u201d from investments on the grounds they \u201clack sophistication\u201d in the internet era.\n\nLet\u2019s look at 1) the SEC and its mandate, 2) crypto\u2019s data solutions and our ability to improve upon the SEC\u2019s product, and then 3) identify some quick consumer protection fixes we could implement as an industry while we flesh out broader regulatory issues in front of us this year.  \n\nThe SEC\n\nThe SEC aims to promote capital formation, while ensuring markets are fair and efficient and investors operate on a level playing field. Information asymmetry and risk disclosure is an especially big area of focus. The SEC requires public securities issuers to report standardized (think GAAP) financial information to the SEC\u2019s EDGAR website. They require rigorous risk and material financial disclosures on a periodic (10-Q\u2019s / 10-K\u2019s) and event-driven (8-K\u2019s / Form 4\u2019s) basis, and the EDGAR data permeates every major financial information source.\n\nIt\u2019s helpful as a foundation, but it\u2019s far from perfect. Uncle EDGAR has an outdated UX and has had his own issues with giving preferential access to high speed traders. Modern hedge funds tend to profit from performance insights they glean between filing periods. The SEC also governs the voting process which requires EDGAR filing, a noisy shareholder proposal process and heavy handed regulations. Finally, they wield enforcement authority - a proverbial hammer looking for a nail that is arguably too primitive and slow to adapt to a market like crypto that evolves at internet speeds.\n\nTheir mission is important. Their execution, historically, has been inadequate.\n\nCrypto Data Vendors\n\nThe fact that blockchains are public data ledgers, and most protocols operate in the open with fully open-source code and decentralized contributors, presents an interesting dilemma when considering information asymmetries and \u201cdisclosures\u201d rules. The data is wide open to public inspection, but there\u2019s no one to standardize its format or delivery. An individual analyst can scrub the data directly (read: Messari & Ripple), or cobble information together from a variety of public sources. Messari, Nansen, Dune Analytics, Coin Metrics, Flipside, AmberData, TokenTerminal, and others all provide excellent resources for crypto\u2019s market participants.\n\nFor our part, we\u2019ve worked to build a bottoms up financial filing equivalent in a realm where the appropriate centralized \u201cdisclosers\u201d of information are difficult to define. Our team has built a library of in-depth project histories and diligence reports, tracks key protocol events and governance items, and pulls together evergreen \u201cfinancial statements\u201d from the ledgers themselves. One of our primary goals is to rebuild the EDGAR 10-Q from first principles, at scale, with 100x improvements in the associated analytics and the periodicity of the reports.\n\nRegulators should like that! The truth is out there, it\u2019s just not evenly distributed.\n\nRemedial Self-Regulatory Efforts\n\nPolicymakers should be patient and exercise restraint when it comes to crypto, but that doesn\u2019t mean that they will. We have a lot of ground to cover in replicating and developing compliance tools that meet modern financial regulations. In the meantime, here are several quick wins:\n\nRally Behind Safe Harbor Disclosures: The industry is furthest along with a model disclosure framework for SEC compliance thanks in large part to Commissioner Hester Peirce. If the SEC wants to foster a more effective disclosure and compliance environment for token issuers, doubling down on a team of lawyers dedicated to suing us isn\u2019t constructive, particularly when many of the cases they bring involve settlements against entities who committed no fraud (e.g. BlockFi settlement) or will take years to settle (e.g. Ripple lawsuit). The SEC should look at what LexPunK Army - some of the best crypto lawyers in the business - have developed with respect to model disclosures and trading rules for tokens as part of their exemptive proposal Regulation X. Or the Commission could open a call for public comment. Or listen to their own commissioner\u2019s calls for a Safe Harbor. The DeFi Education Fund has offered a relevant set of principles.\u00a0 Let\u2019s collaborate on crypto\u2019s version of GAAP reporting for global investors.\nCreate Disclosures Rules for Exchanges and Institutional Token Holders: The publicly available nature of blockchain transactions often obviates the need for many centralized government disclosure structures. If a large holder or \u201cwhale\u201d seems to be buying, selling, or attempting to manipulate the markets, dedicated monitors of block explorers will often post this information directly to Twitter. But the proliferation of privacy-preserving technology means that this won\u2019t always be the case. Regulators could require large crypto investors and custodians to disclose trading activity (such as ownership thresholds, token vesting schedules, and net changes to trading positions) on a periodic or event-driven basis. As an industry, we should work towards this transparency now.\nAdopt a Standard User Risk Waiver and Invest in Education Centers: The onboarding process for new users to centralized crypto services and DeFi protocols alike should include plain english risk disclosures and links to independent, community aggregated reference materials. Imagine a less shitty version of a GDPR pop-up that reminds users - with standardized language - that their principal may be at risk when using a DeFi front-end or third-party custodian. A simple \u201ccaveat emptor\u201d pop-up and link to proper diligence materials would force users to explicitly acknowledge the risks they accept as early users of emerging products. Indeed, the best DeFi protocols already provide a wealth of information in their white papers and user agreements that meet many of the goals of existing consumer protection disclosures. Some even feature APY calculators on their interfaces that are more straightforward than those of their traditional financial institution counterparts.\nCreate Standards Around Proof-of-Reserves and Proof-of-Collateral: This seems like a non-negotiable at this point. Exchanges and custodians that support stablecoins should demand proofs of reserves and collateral behind the assets they list. That doesn\u2019t mean that each supported asset will require a 1:1 reserve or overcollateralization rate necessarily, but it does mean that collateral and credit-worthiness gets listed right alongside APY. The exchanges, custodians, and institutional lenders themselves should also commit - immediately - to proofs of reserves and collateral. This won\u2019t be a choice within a matter of months. Best to make the investment proactively today, and notch the goodwill win while we can.\n\nLet me be clear: these proposals will become table stakes for our future discussions with regulators. As an industry, we have a limited window of time remaining to be proactive about drafting self-regulatory measures ourselves, and this is merely the low-hanging fruit.\n\nIt\u2019s a starting point we can work on today in the aftermath of a massive washout, the backlash of which will be felt for years to come. Let\u2019s get going.", "references": [{"name": "Ryan Selkis", "url": ""}], "published_at": "2022-05-12T00:00:19Z", "author": {"name": "Ryan Selkis"}, "tags": null, "url": "https://messari.io/article/salvation-lies-within"}, {"id": "c03bb6b8-5566-48b2-9f25-68f380d51c2b", "title": "Pangolin: Avalanche-based DEX with a Cross-Chain Vision", "content": "Key Insights\n\nPangolin Exchange is a top two AMM-powered DEXs on Avalanche by trading volume\nPangolin is community-driven, as is reflected in the 100% token distribution to its community.\nThe protocol is currently building out a cross-chain ecosystem, starting with NEAR Protocol. The team plans to operate on multiple chains and support various multichain wallets.  \n\nIntroduction\n\n  \nAs Ethereum\u2019s DeFi applications gained traction, scalability issues became increasingly apparent as gas fees on the blockchain\u2019s ecosystem skyrocketed. The fees were often too high to justify the intended transactions of Ethereum DEX users. For these users, along with those simply looking for cheaper and faster platforms, newer blockchain ecosystems became attractive options.\n\nAvalanche is one of the blockchains where users sought refuge from Ethereum\u2019s congestion problems. Avalanche was launched in September 2020, and it promised to be faster, cheaper, and more flexible than Ethereum. This new blockchain called for the construction of its own DeFi ecosystem, complete with an automated market maker (AMM)-powered decentralized exchange (DEX). The Ava Labs team created Pangolin, but now operations are run and decisions are made by the stakeholders in the community. In this report, we will introduce the Pangolin Exchange, its tokenomics, traction, competitive landscape, risks, and roadmap.\n\nPangolin: Community-Driven and Built on Avalanche  \n\nPangolin was launched as the Avalanche equivalent of Uniswap V2 on Ethereum. Ava Labs launched the protocol in February 2021 and it intended to solve two problems facing AMMs: 1) slow performance, particularly on other chains, and 2) the centralized governance of a few large stakeholders.\n\nHow Pangolin Offers Fast and Cheap Trades\n\nPangolin inherits several of the advantages that Avalanche has over Ethereum. Avalanche is much faster than Ethereum. It can execute 4,500 transactions per second (TPS) while Ethereum only supports 13 TPS. Because Pangolin is built on Avalanche, the protocol can achieve more transactions than other AMM DEXs on Ethereum. In addition, Avalanche\u2019s lower gas fees make trading on Pangolin cheaper than Ethereum-based AMMs. The competitive analysis section in this paper will give a more in-depth comparison of Pangolin and other AMM DEXs.\n\nHow Pangolin Prioritizes Community-Driven Development\n\nIn the pursuit of true decentralization, Pangolin distributes 100% of its governance tokens, PNG, to its community. As of April 23, 2022, there are over 30,000 unique addresses holding PNG. The tokens are not allocated to the team, its advisors and investors, or any other insiders.\n\nThe community of tokenholders can use their PNG to vote on specific proposals to change the Pangolin protocol. These proposals can range from adjusting liquidity mining pool options to modifying the protocol\u2019s fee structure.  \n\nPangolin Core Features and Offerings\n\nThere is no shortage of AMM DEXs in DeFi, and Pangolin has dedicated itself to launching smart, convenient features that set itself apart from competitors. Some of these features include limit orders, Super Farms, and other useful tools.\n\nUser Experience for Generic Swaps\n\nThe protocol has a visually appealing and self-explanatory user interface, shown below. Traders pay a 0.3% fee that is paid out to three parties: 1) with 0.25% paid to liquidity providers, 2) 0.0425% paid to PNG stakers, and 3) 0.0075% paid to Pangolin DAO\u2019s swap fees wallet.\n\nLimit Orders\n\nPangolin users can place limit orders on any tokens on the platform. Users pay a fee for initiating and canceling limit orders. Pangolin\u2019s slippage for their limit orders is held at 0.4%. One such popular use case for limit orders is an arbitrage strategy which profits from temporary stablecoin price fluctuations.\n\nLiquidity Mining Program\n\nPangolin\u2019s liquidity mining program launched at mainnet and distributed PNG to pools with AVAX and PNG as base assets. Pools for AVAX include but are not limited to: AVAX/ETH, AVAX/USDT, AVAX/PNG, and AVAX/LINK. Pools for PNG include but are not limited to: PNG/ETH, PNG/USDT, and PNG/DAI. When the base asset within a pool is not AVAX, then the pool\u2019s liquidity is calculated with the base asset\u2019s value proportional to AVAX.\n\nSuper Farms\n\nPangolin\u2019s Super Farms is a liquidity bootstrapping initiative to help garner more liquidity. Many of these Super Farms are simultaneously offering several, sometimes even 10, different reward tokens. Examples of Pangolin partners who are offering tokens include Lost Worlds (LOST), Kalao (KLO), and Heroes Chained (HEC).\n\nPangolin Partnership Integrations and Co-Development\n\nGnosis Multisig Wallet and Tool  \n\nPangolin is integrated with the Gnosis Multisig Wallet, which is a highly secure wallet that requires multiple confirmations of the same transaction. The Gnosis Multsig Tool includes multi-signatures while retaining privacy and its open-source structure.\n\nBonds on Olympus Pro\n\nPangolin\u2019s integration with Olympus Pro\u2019s Bond program will allow users to receive PNG from their liquidity provider (LP) tokens. This partnership would cushion Pangolin\u2019s long-term liquidity.\n\nMoonPay Integration\n\nMoonPay is essentially a PayPal for DeFi. The integration with MoonPay allows Pangolin users to seamlessly purchase cryptocurrency with their credit cards through MoonPay. The tokens available for purchase include: AVAX, UST, LUNA, NEAR, HBAR, and ATOM. After users finalize their transactions with MoonPay, the tokens are instantly placed into their connected wallets.\n\nNFTrade Co-Development\n\nPangolin released a collection of 16 different NFTs, each with 100 copies. The program encourages users who wish to collect an NFT to stake PNG on NFTrade.com.\n\nTokenomics  \n\nAs mentioned previously, 100% of Pangolin\u2019s PNG tokens are distributed to the community. The protocol\u2019s original litepaper suggested that the total supply would be capped at 538 million tokens. The paper also described an algorithmically powered vesting schedule that would release 256 million tokens for the first four years and then 50% of the previous release for every subsequent four-year cycle. After a proposal to change these tokenomics was approved in September 2021, the maximum total token supply dropped to 230 million.\n\nThe original tokenomics allocated 95% of tokens to fund liquidity mining with 5% reserved for an airdrop. As of now, about 83% of PNG is allocated to liquidity providers, and 13% is allocated to the treasury. According to CoinMarketCap, the current circulating supply of PNG is approximately 94.6 million. In addition to being a governance token, PNG is also a utility token that pays 0.0425% of Pangolin trades to the PNG staking pool.\n\nTraction  \n\nFrom mid-March to mid-April 2022, Pangolin\u2019s 30-day trading volume was $401.4 million. Its year-to-date (YTD) trading is $2.2 billion. In the graphs below, Pangolin\u2019s YTD trading volume trends down, but this followed the overall volume decrease in DEX markets and downturn in DeFi markets.\n\nPangolin also experienced an influx of recent partnership announcements. Its recent partnership with Avalanche Rush, an ecosystem growth allocation program, could indicate potential ecosystem growth. This program would distribute $2 million worth of AVAX rewards to Pangolin\u2019s DEX along with additional LUNA and PNG rewards. The rewards are allocated to Pangolin\u2019s Super Farms to attract more liquidity and traction.\n\nCompetitive Landscape\n\nPangolin\u2019s relatively low ratio of market capitalization to TVL may be an indicator that the protocol is undervalued. In the graph below, YTD trading volume fluctuations for Pangolin, Curve, and Trader Joe follow similar overall trends that correspond to DEX market conditions.\n\nRisks\n\nPangolin faces similar risks as other AMM-powered DEXs, including low capital efficiency.\n\nLow Capital Efficiency  \n\nCapital efficiency refers to the level of liquidity that is being intelligently allocated to generate revenue. Historically, AMMs have been less capital efficient than their order-book counterparts. Order-book exchanges can set trading prices to optimize liquidity utilization. AMM liquidity providers cannot directly influence quoted trading prices, making it harder for them to efficiently allocate liquidity.  \n\nConcentrated liquidity solutions, such as Uniswap V3, mitigate these risks. Pangolin has not announced plans to deploy a concentrated liquidity product, but they could be taking a different approach. This alternative approach is to increase capital efficiency by sourcing liquidity across multiple ecosystems. Pangolin has announced plans to deploy on various networks, starting with NEAR. If they are able to defragment the liquidity that will be sitting on these disparate chains, then they can dramatically increase capital efficiency.  \n\nRoadmap  \n\nPangolin\u2019s Q2 2022 roadmap builds on their Q1 developments and seeks to strengthen its community loyalty. Pangolin\u2019s Q2 2022 roadmap includes: 1) updates that reinforce community loyalty, 2) the development of cross-chain capabilities, and 3) the expansion of revenue streams through product development/updates.  \n\nCommunity Loyalty  \n\nPangolin has developed a new staking mechanism to calculate user rewards while considering the length of time users\u2019 capital was staked.The team branded this the Sunshine and Rainbows (SAR) algorithm. Its goal is to discourage rewards dumping and encourage capital staking for longer periods of time. SAR will be offered in all staking pools, including single-staking ones.  \n\nIn addition to financial rewards, loyal Pangolin community members can also look forward to new private Discord channels that release Pangolin-related alpha and extensive insider reports on DAO operations.  \n\nCross-Chain Capabilities  \n\nPangolin has plans to build on NEAR and will launch airdrop campaigns to market its new platform. To execute its cross-chain strategy and ensure smooth airdrop operations, Pangolin will embed Axelar and Wormhole bridges in its platform\u2019s user interface (UI). Pangolin can use Wormhole\u2019s cross-chain bridges to move native assets on other chains. Axelar\u2019s cross-chain capabilities will add yet another layer of interoperability for Pangolin. It is not simply a bridge but a security mechanism that validates cross-chain asset movements because assets can only be moved across chains when the network reaches consensus.  \n\nDepending on how the Pangolin team aggregates liquidity across chains in the future, multiple chains could share liquidity and lower their capital efficiency risks. The protocol will also build out its new multichain ecosystem by providing more wallet options, including xDEFI, Rabby wallet, NEAR wallet, and more. Pangolin aims to expand its multi-chain community and is actively prospecting other chains for potential integrations. The protocol\u2019s promise to build and strengthen community could be one of its most attractive value propositions for attracting multichain traction.  \n\nOther AMM DEXs, like Uniswap V3, have proven that multi-chain ecosystems attract and retain traction. Uniswap\u2019s organic success on Polygon is a prime example of how multi-chain capabilities can support protocol growth. Uniswap V3 had an 81.7% jump in liquidity on Polygon in Q1 2022 even as the overall market liquidity dropped and liquidity mining incentives scaled back. One possible explanation for Uniswap V3\u2019s success on Polygon is due to the popularity of blue chip token pairs on that platform, which are likely to trade with lower fees. Meanwhile, Uniswap V3 expansions on chains that focused on token pairs with higher fees, like Arbitrum, performed less stellar.  \n\nProduct Updates  \n\nIn Q2 2022, Pangolin V2 will graduate from its beta mode, which sported new interactive features and a more attractive UI. Q2\u2019s upcoming product updates include DEX as a Service or DaaS, which will allow applications to include Pangolin\u2019s swap widget on their platform. The feature will drive more traffic to Pangolin, thereby increasing its trading volume and daily active users. Along with other developments, the Pangolin team will add Zap, a feature which effortlessly permits users to transition from single- to double-sided LP without paying added fees.\n\nConclusion\n\nEthereum\u2019s network congestion attracted DeFi users to AMM DEX platforms on different chains, with one of these platforms being Pangolin on Avalanche. Pangolin started as a fork on Avalanche for Uniswap V2 but has since grown to include additional co-development partnerships and unique features. These features include limit orders and other technical collaborations with powerhouse Web3 tools.  \n\nOne of Pangolin\u2019s most promising roadmap milestones is its developing cross-chain vision. Cross-chain ecosystems are becoming increasingly popular, and Pangolin\u2019s future multichain capabilities will give the protocol a competitive advantage in fostering and maintaining traction. Evidence of this competitive advantage can be found in Uniswap V3 and Curve\u2019s large trading volumes. As Pangolin expands to other chains, like NEAR, it will be able to attract new users and retain its existing community.\n\nThis report was commissioned by Pangolin, a member of Protocol Services.

Welcome to everyone on the call. Thanks for tuning in here. We've got Miles and Ryan from the Decentral Games team with us today. I think we can get things started with a round of introductions from all of us. Miles and Ryan, I don't know if you guys want to go first?\n\nMiles Anthony (00:26): Yeah, thanks for having us, really appreciate it, and thanks for everyone for tuning in.\u00a0 I'm Miles, co-founder and CEO of Decentral Games. We build ICE Poker. It's the first play and earn and poker game in the metaverse. We populate various venues in Decentraland and account for upwards of 60% of the DAU there, so, yeah, really looking forward to diving in a bit more in detail today on this\n\ncall.\n\nRyan De Taboada (00:58): Great. And Ryan here, Operating Officer, Decentral Games. Background, I worked for some big companies like Amazon and Credit Karma. I only made the move full time in 2020. I highly encourage anyone considering it to make the jump. Thanks for having me.\n\nJerry Sun (01:16): Of course! Quick question before we get to our end - what made you guys, start Decentral Games? Just some quick background, I guess.\n\nMiles Anthony (01:27): So, we started Decentral Games kind of in the midst of a bear market. It was in early 2019, after having been a part of the Decentraland community, being, pretty early there, participating in the land sales. And, we were just very bullish on the metaverse back then and we felt that it created a token use case that was very, warranted at the time when a lot of token use cases were not really valid. And we felt that if we were to establish ourselves as kind of a main application within the metaverse, we would benefit from the general adoption of the metaverse which we've kind of seen and just positioned ourselves for a huge influx of users as more and more people kind of explored it. I just started very simple with building, kind of, just, straightforward games like slots, roulette, blackjack, backgammon. Didn't really find the product market fit until we released our ICE Poker game. With a kind of play-to-earn and token model. So, yeah, that's basically the general overview, I'd say.\n\nMihai Grigore (02:47): Fantastic, so on my side, my name is Mihai. I'm an analyst with Messari. Together with my colleague, Jerry, we have co-authored the Decentral Games quarterly. Over to you, Jerry.\n\nJerry Sun (03:06): Sweet. Well thanks for the introduction, Mihai. And another welcome to everyone on this call. I think we can kind of jump into it - I think a lot of people here are kind of curious about the tokenomics of the game. Ryan - something that you mentioned to us a little while back is that the game is really modeled similarly to Axie Infinity, the play-to-earn model. And, as we know, it is a very successful model. Axie Infinity became really big, very prominent globally, but at the same time I think there are some concerns about, \u201cHow does Axie Infinity really build kind of a sustainable token model?\u201d Things like that.\u00a0 Miles, some of the things that you were talking about a little bit earlier in the introduction as well, right - and so just high level. And I think as many people would be interested to know, like, how do you guys think about the sustainability of both your tokens, right - like ICE token and your DG token? How those operate and, like, what the long term outlook looks like for your vision of it?\n\nRyan De Taboada (04:22): Yeah, absolutely. I can comment there. So, it was about a year ago now, a little less, that Axie Infinity was really taking off and saw the success of play-to-earn as a user acquisition model. So, while a lot of these large crypto protocols had like 10 - 20,000 users they were boasting a million, two million people onboarded on the crypto and we came at this from, I think, the reverse perspective of a lot of the play-to-earn games coming to market which is that we had been building a game for the last year which was Texas Hold\u2019em south poker in the metaverse. It was in 3D, social, based on the Unity back-end so we had this fun game. So we could then apply the economics to it started pouring into in the economics that Axie designed around the game and definitely saw they were also pretty transparent about the fact that this breeding model is problematic because if you allow people to sort of exponentially mint new NFTs into your ecosystem you're burning, SLP but creating a lot of these additional assets. The one thing that we built in was an upgrade or vertical progression model. So just taking a step back on the economics, it is similar that you either need to buy an NFT that's decentral and wearable, we launched them in sets of five. These are outfits that you wear in the metaverse and then if you buy one or you have one delegated to you then you get a daily allotment of chip. These chips are not redeemable for anything. They refresh at midnight and then, if you think about Axie\u2019s challenges, depending on the stamina that you have you're able to complete these different challenges. You get different amounts of chips based on how many wearables you're wearing and then you're rewarded based on how you did it over that day but you took your 3,000 chips to 6,000 chips a lot more heights if you lost all three thousand just that day. There's also a time-based component where people need to win a certain number of hands but we guarantee someone doesn't just come in, play one hand finishing the 50th percentile. But then people are earning ICE but people also spend ICE then upgrade their wearables which, makes them cooler flashy and so that's the burning mechanism upgrade progression rather than and then finally we built delegation into our platform because we saw that, on average actually was losing around 10% of that SLP to these skills guild management tools and that it was introducing a third party between the NFT owner and the delegated player. People can manage their own guild directly. I guess we\u2019ll leave it there as an introduction. Miles, do you have anything to add?\n\nMiles Anthony (07:34): Yeah, that's a great overview of our game mechanics, currently. But also it's worth adding, we are constantly trying to add additional utility and sinks in place in the ecosystem for ICE. One of the things that we're most excited about right now is just a tournament mode. We're just going to be rolling out simple, single table sit-and-goes in the metaverse. They'll act as a massive ICE \u200b\u200bsink for the ecosystem. We've briefly, kind of, released a bit of info on this. But generally, we kind of view the existing ICE Poker game, which is scaled over 10,000 DAU in the metaverse as a base layer of getting people actually into the metaverse - something that not many folks have been able to do yet.\u00a0 So, building these other game modes on top of just the general ICE Poker. ICE Poker SNG and many in the future made multi-table tournaments. We want to make it as skill-based as possible, act as these massive ICE sinks for the ecosystem, and just make it fun. So really excited to get those new game modes out. We've been diving in following our deployment of assigned seating last week and stabilization of assigned seating last week. So I think we're in a really lucrative position from a play-to-earn standpoint. Just given the fact that people already are familiar with spending, kind of whether it's tokens or cash or whatever on this game, the game of poker. And so, kind of putting it into an angle for a product was a bit easier for us I would say than most play-to-earn games.\u00a0 That's, kind of, the narrative shifts towards, like, more token burns and token utility as opposed to just rewards. So looking forward to getting those new game modes live as soon as possible.\n\nJerry Sun (09:25): Gotcha, yeah. Ryan, like, you bring up the Axie comparison and I think one of the things that people will say about Axie is that it is a very, kind of, like, rudimentary, elementary game.\u00a0 And if you grow up or you grew up playing triple-A rated, kind of, live action high graphics games, they're going to be really - it's a really difficult transition to move from that type of game to like a Pokemon lite card based game. And so, I mean, we mention in this report, but kind of bringing poker into the fold I think in that way is really smart because a lot of people do play poker it is a very popular game, popular card based game, so it's a good kind of mode for where we are now with the era of blockchain games.\n\nRyan De Taboada (10:21): Yeah, and then . . . sorry, go on . . .\n\nJerry Sun (09:25): No no, Ryan, please.\n\nRyan De Taboada (10:21): I was gonna say yes, 100% agree. Poker has 20 million monthly active to play under this premium model where they're either playing for free and not earning, or they're even paying to climb the range for free. People are familiar with poker, it\u2019s a fun game that many people play without earning. And just to add on to Miles\u2019 point as well, I brought up the upgrade model versus the breeding model, but I completely\u2013I think we completely recognize that no one token sink is like the only sink that's gonna burn all the tokens that are emitted. Like we have advertising deals in a sustainable economy has many parts. It's not just like in and out where tokens are earned one way and then they're burned this other way and we hope that that's worked one-to-one on those two items you have to have many different the whole upgrade token to get to a sustainable economy.\n\nMihai Grigore (11:41): Perhaps in terms of monetization strategy for Decentral Games, we were wondering what that is for the longer term? So, currently we've seen that 93% of your revenue is out of minting of new NFTs and also of upgrades, in-game upgrades. And we were wondering whether these revenue streams will shift over time, so what is your take there?\n\nMiles Anthony (12:13): Yeah. On top of that, for our revenue we bring in quite a bit of revenue just from secondary sales. So, right now all these secondary sales are carried out on OpenSea. For those we charge a 5% fee, so that's been able to fill the treasury governed by DG token holders with ETH. Kind of moving forward we do expect that to grow as we continue expanding our NFT supply in the future. But, yeah, right now we're really just focussed on sustainability and stabilizing the ecosystem. I know a lot of play-to-earn games have kind of been experiencing slight recessions recently. And so right now our main focus is really just just driving stability to the ICE economy. That being said I do think it is substantial the amount of ETH that we bring into the treasury each month from the secondary sales, so one of our biggest initiatives from a product standpoint, engineering standpoint, is building our own ecosystem marketplace. So, kind of moving our secondary sales from OpenSea which, you know, where they currently are, onto our site. Even offering transactions with ICE as well. So we do expect that to both add a lot of ICE utility in general so people are transacting, and holding ICE to participate in the ecosystem from the secondary sales standpoint.\u00a0 But then also charging a fee on that marketplace that's not entirely being extracted by, or partially being extracted by OpenSea. So we do expect that to be a lot more efficient from an ecosystem standpoint. But yeah to answer your question in terms of the model for revenue long term for the treasury the Decentral Games treasury is mainly just these fees for secondary sales.\n\nRyan De Taboada (14:11): During a growth phase the majority of our revenue will come from selling these items where the DG DAO gets 100% of that revenue versus 4.9% of the secondary revenue. But as the economy matures the velocity of these wearables being traded, upgraded, activated is going to make a big difference. So at scale we would expect that to grow roughly proportionally to the number of items, but while we're growing I think the mints will be perhaps not 90% of revenue but the majority of revenue.\n\nJerry Sun (14:49): Longer term do you see some sort of value accrual to DG potentially, as like, purely a governance token right now but this is always a big question, kind of, in the crypto ecosystem.\n\nMiles Anthony (15:05): Yeah, definitely. So right now the DG token holders as a\u00a0 governance token governs a little over 40 million of assets in our treasury and view it on our website. That treasury is fed primarily as Ryan outlined right now by mint proceeds when we do ETH mints as well as the secondary sale volume that is paid in like the royalties. So yeah, that accrual has been nice. We've passed various governance proposals to allocate funds from mints to LPing, we provide all the LPs for DG and ICE pairs from our treasury. And we look forward to, kind of, adding more and more initiatives even around marketing or growth or user acquisition in the future from those clouds. But yeah, the accrual is directly to the treasury which is governed by the DG token holders. So, yes, we - our aim is to accrue value there.\n\nJerry Sun (16:07): Gotcha.\n\nRyan De Taboada (16:12): Yeah, if your question is \u2018what is the relationship between the value of the treasury and the market cap of the token\u2019, that's above my pay grade. I don't know how people are valuing whether revenue or downtime.\n\nJerry Sun (16:07): Yeah, I think it's kind of a question that I guess a lot of people don't know the answer to right now because of how tokens are categorized. I suppose five, ten years from now you can see like dividends or more closer to traditional equities or this is the whole, like, securitization of tokens and what that might mean. That's beyond all of us, right? That's up for regulatory policy. But I'm just kind of curious as to how projects are, kind of, thinking about that right now, right? We can go to some of the daily average metrics here if we want to jump to the next slide.\n\nMihai Grigore (17:12): Absolutely. So here we're able to see a progression in terms of a number of daily active users reaching close to 12,000 recently. The amount of players is bound to the number of NFTs that are minted, so we counted them all together and we came to the number of 14,000. So, here we were wondering if we have like 12,000 daily active users that require at least one NFT in order to be able to play. Would it be a fair way to compute a utilization metric here? Would that be dividing the 12,000 daily active users by the total amount of NFTs which is 14,000. Is that the fair metric, or would you measure it differently?\n\nMiles Anthony (18:10): For the utilization of the NFTs, it's a bit\u2013there's another layer in there in that these wearables are actually stackable and so you can actually wear up to five different wearables at the same time this gives you a larger bonus. And we've actually increased these bonuses recently with a governance proposal and so Ryan can kind of dive into a bit more detail on the utilization rate that we have with those. But, yeah, so some players obviously play with\u2013 two, three, four, up to five wearables and so the DAU actually could be slightly lower than the actual total amount of wearables being utilized.\n\nRyan De Taboada (18:52): Yeah, I don't have anything to add there, just that that's about right, particularly if you look at Q1 that the majority of players are playing with one wearable. There's 12,000 DAU and 14,500 wearables, but we've actually seen stacking increase and we've continued to incentivize that as a behavior that could go into more detail about why we think that's good for the ecosystem. But, I\u2019d say the utilization rate is a little higher than that because not everyone is playing with one, but not a ton. I see people in the chat are mentioning that they\u2013 \u2018I have 11 wearables stacked on three delegates\u2019 [thanks josh]. That's been a more recent trend whereas it was more like one-to-one last quarter.\n\nJerry Sun (19:45): Gotcha. That makes sense. The first question that I have, just for me, is in terms of web3 games, especially something like ICE Poker where a lot of ICE rewards are distributed, if you complete daily challenges or certain objectives, do you guys have any issue with bots? Have you kind of seen that if, for example, you check in and you're able to, kind of, be eligible for certain rewards, like, are bots able to go and do that, or have you thought about this problem?\n\nMiles Anthony (20:15): Yeah, it's definitely been discussed pretty to a certain extent in our community. In terms of bots in Decentraland, it's a bit tough to code a bot to, navigate in the 3D environment, sit at a table and click on the 3D buttons to play the game. The main issue we had was just, kind of, people, multi-accounting. But manually multi-accounting. We've added measures in place to prevent against this. Right now we only allow one account per user. And so luckily we haven't really had to deal with too many bots. That's going to be a main focus as we roll out our mobile products and kind of our web-based 2D products. Obviously that'll be a bit more of an attack vector there, so we are going to be taking measures to prevent that a bit more seriously from that product standpoint.\u00a0 But, that being said, I think with our current product, it is a bit tough to bot, just given the environment of the game.\n\nRyan De Taboada (21:19): Yeah, but also want to address it, as people in the chat are calling out, and as you see on that chart that we, this was a major initiative last quarter to assign seats so that someone with multiple tabs open, multiple VPNs, it's not sitting with multiple accounts. We actually assign a seat at a table when you walk in that flow is challenging in 3D virtual worlds to come in and say for this user you need to go sit at this table in space but that's now out, and there are still remaining attack vectors I think across games this will continue to be a really important point but we'll also, as Miles mentioned, have a lot more control over the experience within the mobile version which we're taking the opposite example of existing play-to-earn engines, right? Everyone else has a browser-based 2D either mobile or tablet version. We\u2019re expanding in where we started three years ago in Decentraland, in the virtual world and we\u2019re launching mobile in the coming months, and we\u2019re very excited about that.\n\nJerry Sun (22:29): In reference to assigned seating here and this dip it's a very temporary thing. It seems like it was just kind of like a one or two day situation but what was, kind of, the factor here that caused daily average user count to go down? Was it just inability to log in, or just, like, unfamiliarity with the change? Any, kind of, insight there?\n\nMiles Anthony (22:53): Right, yeah, so assigned seating is definitely a feature that we do think we should have implemented a lot sooner than we did. Just given the attack vector of folks being able to collude. But, that being said we tried to get it live about a month ago, initially, and there were issues with scale. Like we tested with our QA team to a large extent with no issues. Even tested with our beta testing community, 40, 50, 60 amount of users at the time with no issues. And we experienced these issues once we went to production. Had 1,500 daily active concurrent players right there playing and using the feature. And so we had that, we had to rethink, kind of, the architecture of it because, clearly, as we released it, back at the end of March there were issues with the feature. The way it managed assignments and unassigned people once they left the table that we didn't really see with the lower amount of users. So, that being said, we kind of redesigned the architecture on the back-end, upgraded our back-end architecture from a hosting standpoint, as well, and then relaunched it last week. Since then, it's performed much much better than it did, prior - and so, yeah, we're really excited because I think this feature is essential and it was kind of like obviously like ripping a band-aid off because it's so essential as we plan to roll out tournament mode like sit-and-gos and then eventually multi-table seat assignments going to be a key part of that just to prevent any collusion. And so it was something that needed to be done. Obviously, we would have preferred to have done it sooner than later, but, we're really happy that we were able to get it out there live.\n\nJerry Sun (24:29): Gotcha. So, I guess for people on the call who may not know the gameplay as well, we're just kind of tuning in to hear about the game with the assigned seating feature. Let's say I have a friend who wants to play poker with me, and we want to go play together, but we, you know, let's say this is metaverse, right?\u00a0 We can go and enter the metaverse and play. With assigned seating, are we not able to go and, kind of, sit at the same table? Or how does that work?\n\nMiles Anthony (25:06): That's correct, yeah. With assigned seating you get assigned a table randomly within the venue that you enter. There is a chance you could get assigned the same table, but it's unlikely. And, yeah, this is, I mean, this is mainly just to prevent people from abuse - of abusing - the rewards system. Because once you've put an incentive in place based on performance, and, obviously people are going to try to exploit it. So it is not ideal because you can't sit next to your friends. But we do have a venue that has just like free-play poker and a non-ICE poker, that if you do want to play poker in the metaverse with your friends you can hop in there and play, right?\n\nJerry Sun (25:48): Right, no. I don't want to cheat, I'm just asking, I guess, for the purposes of this call here to answer one of the questions.\n\nMiles Anthony (25:54): That being said, the chat actually brought up a good point. So we do have, like, one venue, that we, where we allow open seating currently called Diamond Hands City. Basically Diamond Hands refers to the level five wearables. So if you upgrade your wearable four times to level five, it becomes a very flashy and golden wearable. It's very noticeable. And it's kind of like a digital or virtual flex and so if you own one of these top level wearables, then you're able to access this Diamond Hand City venue and it's a very opulent 3D venue.\u00a0 And in there you're actually able to play with your friends. So yeah, you can play ICE Poker with your friends, but you do have to put in a lot of work to earn your way to that status.\n\nJerry Sun (26:46): Gotcha, gotcha. All right, well if you want to jump down I think we can talk about some of these secondary sales. I guess like one of the data points that we saw, just looking at sales data for wearables, is when you take a look it seems like rank one, rank five NFTs, they're actually selling on average for, I guess, you would say on average they're selling for the least and then you're actually seeing like rank two, three, four NFTs selling for, like, generally higher. Obviously there's a lot of data points here but I'm kind of curious to hear your thoughts on that. Like if you're grinding, you're grinding out to level five and you get the highest level NFT, you're actually not, I guess, on average potentially selling it - based on data points that we have - selling it for as much as maybe even a rank four or, like, rank two. Do you have any, kind of, thoughts on that kind of secondary sales ecosystem of these NFT wearables?\n\nRyan De Taboada (27:56): That's very interesting because those data points called out are from March. I don't know, the additional variable would be the collection so we do have some, like, there's the Genesis collection, the very first one that does more volume and generally at a higher price, but in general, I would say, for the same wearable in the same question, like, a level five is always going to sell for more than level fours and level three because a level four wearable can be you're in some experience points you've been sometimes upgraded it's just worth strictly less than the level five of that same wearable, so it must be some sort of mix \u2026 mix in the data if it's not fully clear from here that some collections maybe early collections, mid-levels, something higher than late-collection level five. I'm not sure.\n\nJerry Sun (28:51): That makes sense. And we do not differentiate between the different collections and, like, when they were minted. Here, this is just kind of all sales of any of these levels. In our report we kind of talked about potentially being that level two, three, four NFT sales are just less generally we see more sales of level one or level five NFTs, so it is a small kind of data point sample size for the mid-tier level NFTs compared to those on the end.\n\nRyan De Taboada (29:25): Yeah, we've done a ton of volume on OpenSea, as Miles mentioned earlier. Number one on Polygon, we look at 30 or 90 days and about about 12,000 ETH in volume on OpenSea, which we took 2.5% of that is a lot of value that's leaving the ecosystem to feed to them, which is why an initiative for this quarter is to have our own marketplace where things are priced. You have the option to price ICE, but also, that money isn't leaving the ecosystem to OpenSea. And I think why we've seen other large games have their own marketplace like Axies are tradable on their own marketplace and others, so I think that'll be a big win for us. A big component of our revenue comes from these secondary sales and the subsequent activation of the wearables.\n\nMihai Grigore (30:18): Right. Speaking of secondary sales, how do you incentivize players to upgrade instead of selling?\n\nMiles Anthony (30:26): For the upgraded items, typically they will have a price for it that is higher than the previous level, and then also they have a higher bonus variable. And so as you upgrade, the bonus range which you're randomly assigned increases, and so you actually earn more rewards for these higher level wearables. I would say those are the two main incentives to upgrade.\n\nMihai Grigore (30:52): And is there any plan to slow down these rewards over time?\n\nMiles Anthony (30:59): At the moment we recently passed the governance proposal to lower some of the rewards, just from a multiplier standpoint. So we've only done this, two times before. Basically adjusting the multipliers for the leaderboard. The leaderboard is basically broken down into 20 tiers based on your percentile. Percentiles are ranked by net chips. So, obviously, if you win a lot more then you're at the top, if you\u2019re losing, you're at the bottom and or less. And this change that we recently enacted - actually, yesterday, at the end of the day - reduces rewards slightly. And, so, into the future, it's mainly just up to the DAO to decide if we want to reduce these rewards further, just to stabilize the ICE ecosystem, but at the moment we don't really have any plans specifically to raise or reduce the existing rewards.\n\nJerry Sun (32:00): Will there be an oversaturation of level five NFTs, or, like, rank five NFTs if that's kind of the case?\u00a0 Because I'm thinking about the typical game inflation narrative, right? Where, like, the longer you've been playing, it's going to be easier and easier to get level five NFTs, in theory. Because people are going to have more experience, they're going to have more ICE that they've earned through the gameplay.\n\nAnd as users continue to grow, daily users continue to rise, things like that, then naturally they are just going to be more and more rank five NFTs over time. And then since there's nowhere to go after rank five, then there's just going to be, kind of, over time, this potential surplus of level five NFTs. Have you guys, kind of, thought about that?\n\nRyan De Taboada (32:50): Yeah. So, to comment there - like, we do still see that the level fives are less than right around ten percent of the total NFTs in the ecosystem which is seven months into launch. So, because when new NFTs enter the ecosystem, they enter at level one. So, certainly growth helps us maintain a more healthy balance where there's a ton of potential upgrading left and then I would add that the progression is long from delegated player to player-owner to perhaps owner of a level five item or owner of two or three level ones that you're upgrading and then even if you did upgrade five items, there are many people who have ten items or twenty items and are delegating those out. So, I think there's a frequent use case here who might have ten items, half of which are level five, or two of them are level five, and, even if they upgraded them, they might buy another level one and keep upgrading it. So, there's really no end to this progression of delegated-player, player-owner or stacking wearables as a player-owner or guild manager. You're delegating out and growing the size of your guild. I think that over the very long term, and particularly if growth were slow, that would become more of a concern. But for the time being, there's a ton of this vertical progression and this progression within, you know, for ultimately different games. There's the game of poker we're playing here and then within these play-to-earn economies there's the game of being a guild manager. And, like, if you have below average players in your guild, you're going to earn less than half of someone who has above average players in your guild. So there really is this additional level of gameplay that is field management, too.\n\nMihai Grigore (34:40): So with respect to this vertical progression, where do you guys spend more time at the moment? Is it getting delegated players to actually own an NFT, or is it by motivating existing NFT owners to actually upgrade in-game?\u00a0 What is the reward structure there? Or where do you spend more time in motivating the players?\n\nMiles Anthony (35:10): I would say there's not, like, one or the other, we spend the most time on obviously two both are a priority. I think our main priorities that we outlined a bit earlier today are really just stabilized an ICE ecosystem, creating an outstanding gameplay experience. And so obviously part of that is welcoming folks in from delegated-player to player-owner and going from player-owner to owning multiple wearables and guild owner I think it really just starts with just improving the game and right now, as we touch upon the game is very simple as just a base layer. And once we add in these additional tournament mode like sit-and-go's, it should add a lot more incentive, but also add a nice progression for a player that wants to, kind of, grind these tournaments to either earn their way to a wearable or earn prizes to get to that point, a lot faster than just buying one directly if they're skilled. I would say it's definitely split between the two. But really, it's overarched. It all kind of wraps back into our objective of just stabilizing the ecosystem and creating a game that's really fun to play.\n\nJerry Sun (36:30): Right, right. Ethan, if we want to jump down a slide. No particular question here but we definitely thought it was really interesting data. One more, Ethan. I think there should be like a bar chart that has some pretty interesting data. Another one. Yes, I think this one. I mean, no particular question from this but this is definitely pretty insightful. I guess what we saw was, over time, we saw that we compared the mint price for level one NFTs to, immediately flipping the NFTs in a secondary market, Like, how much would a player arguably stand to gain. And, like, with the drop, number one you can kind of see things with price a little bit lower, I mean, it was a new game at the time. And, in more, some of the more recent drops and I know this data is kind of ends at the end of March for Q1 but, like, the more recent drops of some of which of course were priced in ICE, like, drop 9, 10, 11, a lot closer to the immediate flip price. And, I thought that was a great decision and it kind of incentivizes players to not just go and mint-and-flip right away, but to actually, grind and to play the game and try to go and upgrade. If you're buying it then you're more likely invested in the ecosystem. I guess, Ethan, we want to go down. So, yeah this was pretty interesting data here. But we got some questions about, kind of, governance and roadmap. So, the first question I've got is - I know one of the major governance updates in the DAO is very active for decentral gamesIone of the major governance updates that caught my eye was allowing partnerships in the metaverse advertisements in these ICE Poker venues. Any opportunity for you guys to, kind of, speak on that - how that is kind of coming along on your end?\n\nMiles Anthony (38:44): Yeah, definitely. So, yeah the partner to ads is just a it's just a great initiative I know it's been a few months since we originally passed the proposal we've been really just trying to find the right partner that not only you know find, really solid partners to advertise, but also be able to take payment from them and then, pay the DAO in ICE to contribute to the burn-to-earn. So, that's kind of been a process but we're really close to finalizing a deal with a great partner that's crypto native, kind of, gaming native and has experience working with some of these big brands. Really just targeting brands that potentially have a presence in the metaverse build scenes of Decentraland but don't necessarily have any way of, like, providing their scene or their deployment with ongoing users. And, so, really this just revolves around the fact that we've been able to solve one of the main issues with the metaverse currently which is just emptiness. We have over a 1,000-1,500 or so concurrence in our venues 24/7. And being able to monetize that traffic in a space that's extremely nascent, it's incredibly valuable. And, so, yeah, we do expect to announce, kind of, the more details on that deal initially in the next week or two. But\u00a0 finalizing it - it's in the final stages. And it's been great to also, kind of, bring on board Matt, our new CMO to, kind of, finalize and manage these deals going forward. So really looking forward to sharing more details on that soon.\n\nJerry Sun (40:29): Gotcha. And that's, kind of, in its own way a game sink in itself, right? Because they're going to be doing these deals through the ICE token?\n\nMiles Anthony (40:40): Yeah, exactly. So, for now we thought it would be a great way to just add utility price from an advertiser's standpoint. And then just contribute towards the ratio of the ecosystem. Thought it would be a huge win for the community. I know everyone's pretty excited about this and it's just value that we're just not capturing at the moment given our presence and, kind of, leadership in populating the metaverse.\n\nMihai Grigore (41:09): Do you expect that to affect somehow the growth of users that you currently see?\n\nMiles Anthony (41:18): I don't think it would affect the growth of users too much. It's mainly just putting up different still or video ads within the venues that the users will be able to see but I don't think it will negatively impact the user experience nor our user growth.\n\nMihai Grigore (41:36): Speaking of user experience, we've read about the forthcoming mobile version of the game. Could you tell us a couple of words about that? So how that is going to be rolled out?\u00a0 Maybe a timeline for it and how it is going to be different from the desktop version?\n\nMiles Anthony (41:55): Yeah. definitely. So\u00a0 by being, kind of, one of the first movers in the metaverse and into Decentraland, there's obviously some constraints from a scalability standpoint. And, so, we felt that in January or so, that building a mobile first kind of experience that's also accessible on desktop via PWA would be a great way to be able to expand our user base, outside of Decentraland and really own the full client experience for the product. And, so, yeah, we've been developing it over the last several months. Our header product, Leo, has put together kind of a phase-by-phase rollout plan. We're currently just in the phase of, kind of, internal testing within the team in QA. The next step will be closed alpha - looking to bring in 50 to 100 community members to test it daily. Moving into closed beta, then we're kind of moving towards several hundred community members, and then finally a launch. And so the thing that we've been discussing more recently in detail is like obviously we're going to be bringing in users to help test this without rewards initially. Kind of, planning out the launch of this, I think it's really, kind of, ties back into our discussion earlier about the tournament mode, kind of SNG style gameplay. And, so, we're really figuring out, kind of, the best approach for that final, you know, that fourth phase of the rollout which will include potentially distributing some of these mobile wearables via rewards from SNG. So, exploring, kind of, just launching that version first before even doing any mobile mints or anything. So, yeah, I think these two game modes really will complement each other really nicely.\u00a0 Because ICE Poker as it stands, is kind of a great tool for user acquisition and growth. At the same time, it kind of emits decent amount of tokens whereas the SNG will be a massive token sink so actually I take in tokens from the community burn them while also delivering a really fun kind of more competitive skill-based gameplay experience and then ultimately SNG will be able to distribute wearables to the community as prizes. So, yeah, I think the two game modes together will complement each other really nicely and it was always kind of the plan to roll out ICE Poker SNG or ICE Poker tournament mode, we just were kind of delayed a bit from the assigned seating implementation. But now that that's live and stable we're really excited to dive into this new game mode for both metaverse and mobile and all metaverse NFTs currently in circulation will be usable with the SNG gameplay as well.\n\nJerry Sun (45:06): In regards to another one of these governance updates, there was a proposal to go and implement NFT drops using the ICE token instead of ETH because previously it was all done in ETH and then this governance proposal got passed and now it looks like there are these drops when they occur simultaneously, or not simultaneously, I guess they're announced simultaneously and they occur kind of a couple weeks after each other, but one of them will be done in ETH and then one of them will be done through ICE tokens. Do you guys think like long term, and this is also up to the DOA, but just from your guy's perspective, is that something you would like to go and eventually see long term is a move towards ICE-based mints full time, or is this do you like this kind of combination where you switch back and forth between ETH and ICE?\n\nMiles Anthony (46:02): I would say from, you know, from the beginning it was healthy to switch back and forth even like prioritizing eight minutes to start. But granted our main focus right now is stabilizing the ICE ecosystem and ICE in-game economy, we have been heavily kind of leaning towards the ICE mints. I think it's just a very powerful tool that the DAO has to, kind of, stabilize things going forward and respond to market conditions to be able to employ either one. That being said, our next mint is tomorrow collab mint with the Mutant Cartel folks and that one is in ICE. And I believe the last two or so mints have been in ICE. So, definitely leaning more towards ICE just as we, you know, end up stabilizing our ecosystem.\n\nJerry Sun (46:52): Right, right. The move towards ICE I think is, again, talking about game scene. So, we've been kind of talking about that throughout this call, but it is a nice way of implementing new games for ICE that's kind of out there among players to come back into the ecosystem. We do have some questions here, it looks like, from the community.\u00a0 So I want to make sure that we get to these. I'll just start, kind of, from bottom to top. So, \u201cWill the DAO infuse funds into the USDC/ICE LP pool if needed?\u201d\n\nMiles Anthony (47:35): It looks like that was submitted as a proposal recently.\n\nYeah, I mean, it's really, you know, up to the DAO to decide how to manage LPs, you know. We provide liquidity for both DG and in ICE pairs. So, in so far as the LP position for ICE has dropped a bit in terms of total value locked in the pool. And, so, yeah, we can absolutely consider adding to it. At the moment, we haven't really considered that internally just because the ICE pool seems to be pretty healthy at the moment with minimal slippage, just given the fact there's around like 4.5 to 5 million dollars in the pool.\n\nJerry Sun (48:20): Gotcha. A couple people wanted to know about whether or not multiple tabling would be allowed, or, like, multi-tabling would be allowed for local players. Why it's not allowed now, and then, I suppose, to add on to that, whether or not it will ever be allowed, kind of, in the future?\n\nMiles Anthony (48:52): So, right now, so far we haven't allowed it. Just given the fact that assigned seating wasn't live and, you know, it welcomes, kind of, just like this farming gameplay which we're kind of trying to stay away from. Now that assigned seating is live, and now that we're going to be rolling out tournament mode obviously, there's been, kind of, dialogue in our Discord to bring back this conversation as a community. And, so, yeah, I think Leo, our head of products, spoke about this even at the last roundtable that we hosted. That we are considering opening it up for multiple accounts playing in ICE Poker SNG. Just given the nature of the game play and given the fact that it's not really welcoming to, you know, the farming kind of mentality of gameplay. So, yeah, it's absolutely on the radar. I'm just trying to figure out what the best way would be to implement it. Mainly just to prevent against abuse.\n\nJerry Sun (49:49): Right. Cool. So, it sounds like it's gonna be potentially implemented in the future, but you guys are taking these baby steps to get there to make sure that, when it is implemented, it's going to be done in a, like, appropriate manner?\n\nMiles Anthony (50:05): That's correct.\n\nJerry Sun (50:07): Cool. \u2018Vixx\u2019 wanted to ask \u201cCan you guys touch on how assigned seating in low population realms is effective against check-cheaters and colluders?\u201d And maybe just because it's a low population realm you know there's not a lot of activity compared to some other ones but, I don't know.\u00a0 Do you have any kind of thoughts on this question here?\n\nMiles Anthony (50:30): Yeah. For assign seating, you know, obviously, the implementation that we push live isn't perfect and there's been talk about actually even reducing the amount of venues, kind of, closing down one of our venues just to\u00a0 congregate users, kind of, more in our three other venues in four, yeah \u2026 But, yeah, I mean, if you're going into a low populated realm, it still is kind of tough to get paired at the same table because it will assign players to up to five tables. But, there are user experience kind of hurdles in that sense. So, yeah, I think in our next iteration of the assigned seating we're thinking about doing it just from the website and having that kind of feed into specific venues, or specific tables within venues. So it\u2019ll be a much more effective implementation. But that being said, I do think, you know, the current implementation does prevent against most abuse which was much needed at the time.\n\nJerry Sun (51:30): Right.\n\nRyan De Taboada (51:32): Yeah, I wanted to also just comment more broadly on that, like, you can see from the question in the chat here, this is a really hot topic and this is something that, ICE Poker being a skill-based game, arguably either one of the few, or the only, like, actual skill-based, play-to-earn ecosystem that exists right now is like a huge benefit and selling point and makes it fun for people to come back where poker is a little different every day. But it also creates an incentive structure where bad actors can, if they find some work-around when we've developed multi-accounting, VPN sort of stuff, there is an incentive structure to cheat, basically. Whereas like there's really no cheating in completing your twelve challenges with an action, something like that. And, so, like this is a constant struggle for us where we want to make the game more skill-based, and, say, we're going to reward more and more of the people who play poker well, and reward less the ones that play poorly. Assigned seating was a huge component of that that needed to be rolled out with updates and challenges. And then we would love to allow people who have purchased multiple wearables to play on multiple tables, but it just adds to the complexity right now of a problem that we're trying to solve. So, I think we can get there. It's not the highest priority when we need to make sure that the game has high integrity. People are coming in and are playing poker that is legitimately similar to any other poker game and are playing with good actors who don't have any unfair advantage against them. So, definitely a top priority for us and we need this to be skill-based and fair.\n\nJerry Sun (53:19): Right. I think that's one of the things that, kind of, come along with choosing poker as your application. The game is very popular, and, like I mentioned, people do know how to play, but it is skill-based, so, in terms of people being good at it, or some people just doing it casually, there is that kind of discrepancy. Cool.\n\nMiles Anthony (53:42): Exactly.\n\nMihai Grigore (53:48): So, perhaps, what do you think is going to be the next successful game that is also skill based, and is not poker?\n\nMiles Anthony (53:59): ICE Poker SNG - Yeah, I think we're really bullish on that. And I think it's something that we \u2026 it's, like, just low hanging fruit, something we can actually deliver on really quickly. And, we touched on earlier, it's just a great way of just creating a more fun gameplay mode. But also just, kind of, allowing folks that are good at, you know, winning, to win their way to ownership, kind of, to feed that kind of progression from delegated-player to player-owner. So, yeah I'm really looking forward to launching that.\n\nJerry Sun (54:37): Sweet.\n\nRyan De Taboada (54:37): Yeah, I would maybe say, it's really hard to do, like, board games or anything that's a solved problem for a computer. Like, if you did play-to-earn chess, that's probably going to be tough because it's very easy to cheat at chess even if you have, like, another device over here and bring them in. Maybe some sort of, like, \u2018Settlers Of Catan\u2019 style game where you are, like, trading resources or something that is fairly skill-based and, like, very dependent on what other individuals do within the game. So, not something we're working on. But bullish on the idea that some board games could perhaps be replicated within play-to-earn and NFTs and also lends itself well to NFTs. Mainly what we\u2019re saying. That's potentially a good idea.\n\nJerry Sun (55:25): Yeah. Just to, kind of, close out with some of these remaining ones, \u2018Will there, when community events, tournaments or other fun things, they see Miles come play in DHC?\u2019\n\nMiles Anthony (55:40): In Diamond Hand City? Yeah, unfortunately recently I haven't been able to like hop in too much to play ICE Poker with the community. Just given the fact that we're just trying to ship so many parallel items. But, we host community events almost daily. Our community events manager, Murph does a great job of bringing in artists to perform, live concerts, as well as even, like, comedy shows within our venues. And they're streamed kind of on the wall in those venues. And, so, yeah, we \u2026 if you're looking for community events, like, we have a bunch of them lined out on the events page of our website. But, yeah, in terms of the actual team hopping in to play in Diamond Hand City, we could definitely do that a bit more often. We just get swamped.\n\nJerry Sun (56:37): Yeah, totally understandable. The last question from the community - I guess right now everything is in Decentral Games and there's, you know, in terms of metaverse, there's so many metaverses being built out simultaneously. No one really knows which metaverse is going to be the winner-take-all, or, like, how that's going to work. Any future plans, any future thoughts on, maybe, like, expanding to anything else? I see some people saying Otherside? That was just, kind of, this thing occurred recently, right? What are your guys' thoughts on that?\n\nMiles Anthony (57:08): Yeah, it's been a point of discussion for a while. Pretty much since we started DG. You know, \u2018Is DG going to move to other metaverses?\u2019 Initially we weren't going to. Really because of the just, like, the requirements for our games. A lot of these metaverses that popped up, or virtual worlds that popped up, didn't\n\nreally have any SDK with, like, custom scripting with the ability to, kind of, code like a poker game. For example, a lot of them, kind of, were more geared towards the drag-and-drop development experience with not a lot of custom logic. But, yeah, more recently we've seen a lot of them pop up that could potentially host our games. So, yeah, we're considering - we're looking at - you know, other platforms to expand ICE Poker. And, yeah, one of them that, you know, even Ryan is really excited about is the Otherside. So, trying to figure out more information and really eager to look at their SDK once they release that. Not really sure what the timeline is per se. But once we have that, we can really map out a game plan, if appropriate.\n\nJerry Sun (58:23): Cool. Good stuff.\n\nRyan De Taboada (58:26): Yeah. We're waiting for another metaverse to be ready for us.\n\nJerry Sun (58:32): I like that answer! I like that answer!\n\nRyan De Taboada (58:33): You have an open SDK, etc.\n\nJerry Sun (58:38): I like that answer. It sounds like there's avenues for growth. Whether it's waiting for a metaverse to be ready for games, or the mobile app and things like that, and some of these features you guys\u00a0 are working on. So, definitely exciting times. It's cool to see, kind of, daily and reducers continue to increase all these, you know, good metrics, kind of trending in the right direction. So, yeah. I think we\u2019re about to hit an hour here. So I think we can wrap things up. Appreciate you guys calling in and appreciate everyone on the call, kind of, following along and asking questions.\n\nRyan De Taboada (59:15): Awesome. Thanks for having us.\n\nMiles Anthony (59:17): Yeah, thank you so much for having me.\n\nMihai Grigore (59:19): Thank you, bye guys.\n\nJerry Sun (59:21): Thanks, Ryan. Thanks, Miles.

Preliminary discussions are ongoing.  \n\nSector Returns\n\nIt is a red day as not just cryptocurrencies but the broader markets have suffered continued losses driven by Fed rate hikes. The global cryptocurrency market shed 7% of its market cap just this week, coming down from $1.8 to $1.67 trillion. The hardest hit sector was gaming, which posted a 10.12% loss for the week. Smart contract platforms had the least decline for the week as the sector has shown some resilience amidst the broader crypto market downturn.\n\nTop Assets\n\nThe category of top assets by market capitalization was the second worst hit among the sectors covered. This was mainly due to the three smart contract platform assets which all took double-digit losses. These were Avalanche (AVAX) with -13.3%, Solana (SOL) with -14.9%, and Polkadot with -15.1%.\n\nDeFi Assets\n\nThe DeFi sector declined by 5.85% this week, which puts it just above the middle of the pack compared to the other sectors covered. The sector had only one asset end the week in positive territory \u2014 Curve (CRV). The decentralized exchange\u2019s token saw its price rally by 12% on Wednesday after Abra, a financial services company acquired 5.78 million CRV. Is this a sign of institutions stepping in to buy the dip? Kava (KAVA) on the other hand, took the heaviest loss of the sector and was the second worst performing asset within the top assets covered. The cross-chain DeFi platform\u2019s token saw a 29.4% decline for the week. \n\nSmart Contract Platforms\n\nEven though the smart contract platform sector saw half of its top assets post double-digit negative returns for the week, one asset\u2019s performance was enough to offset the damage to some extent. TRON (TRON) was the clear outperformer within the sector as it broke away from the pack early in the week and maintained its performance to the end. The TRON token ended the week with a 14.8% return.\n\nCurrencies\n\nThe currencies sector saw all of its top assets end the week in negative territory. Even though all of its top assets posted losses for the week, the sector came in second place in terms of least decline. Zcash was the laggard of the group as the privacy token had a rough start to the week and was not able to make a recovery. ZEC ended the week with a 14.3% decline.\n\nWeb3\n\nThe Web3 sector had a tough week as 9 out of the 10 top assets posted double-digit losses. Filecoin (FIL) and Audius (AUDIO) secured the penultimate and ultimate positions, respectively. FIL ended the week with a 23.2% loss while AUDIO declined by 25%. \n\nGaming\n\nThe Web3 sector\u2019s top asset losses were humbled by gaming sector\u2019s. Gaming was the worst performing of the sectors covered in the report. Eight of the top ten assets in the sector secured double-digit losses. Yield Guild Games (YGG) had the worst performance within all top assets covered, ending the week with a substantial 38.2% loss.\n\n", "references": [{"name": "Guillermo Avil\u00e9s", "url": ""}], "published_at": "2022-05-06T14:10:00Z", "author": {"name": "Guillermo Avil\u00e9s"}, "tags": ["Macro"], "url": "https://messari.io/article/weekly-recap-may-6"}, {"id": "f4e87208-973f-4384-bec6-1428665691a5", "title": "State of Livepeer Q1 2022", "content": "Download the PDF version of this report by clicking here.\n\nKey Insights\n\nIn Q1 2022, Livepeer processed over 33 million minutes of transcoded video, up 12% from the previous quarter.\nNode operator revenue in ETH grew 22% (decreased 13% in USD terms due to the overall market downturn).\nRevenue from LPT staking rewards grew 18% (decreased 12% in USD terms).\nSince Livepeer\u2019s migration to Arbitrum, operating on the network has become feasible for smaller players as fees decreased ~97%.\nLivepeer is looking to expand its service offering with in-video object recognition and scene classification capabilities.\n\nLivepeer in a Nutshell\n\nBuilding decentralized video apps like Twitch or TikTok requires heavy infrastructure for streaming. Based on the user\u2019s bandwidth and device, video content needs to be processed into viewable formats. This process is called transcoding and is used, for instance, every time when watching a live event on a smartphone.\n\nWhile cloud providers like AWS, Google, or Microsoft are commonplace solutions for video transcoding services, they incur high costs. Livepeer is an open marketplace for decentralized video infrastructure that aims to reduce the cost of video streaming by 10x.\n\nThe main stakeholders within the Livepeer network are node operators, transcoders, and delegators.\n\nNode operators \u2013 called \u201corchestrators\u201d in Livepeer \u2013 supply video transcoding services to applications and developers. Node operators receive raw video content as input and are responsible for returning transcoded results. To perform these services, node operators must stake the native Livepeer asset, LPT. The more LPT a node operator stakes, the more work it can perform on the Livepeer network.\n\nTranscoders provide the computational resources for node operators to perform video transcoding. Essentially anyone with idle GPU computing capacity can run Livepeer software as a transcoder to facilitate video streaming and earn fees in return. Given that not every transcoder operates a node on the Livepeer network, transcoders may choose to allocate their computational resources to node operator pools.\n\nDelegators are individuals and entities that stake LPT with node operators. By design, delegators choose to route stake to the most effective nodes, in exchange for a portion of ETH fees and newly minted LPT.\n\nUsage at All-Time-High\n\nDemand for Livepeer services comes from applications and developers in need of video transcoding services. For example, user-generated content applications require streaming infrastructure to broadcast videos to followers. These applications pay node operators a fee in ETH for transcoding services. Livepeer\u2019s network usage can be gauged by how many minutes of video are transcoded.\n\nQ1 2022 saw a record of over 33 million minutes of transcoded video processed on the Livepeer network. This is a 12% increase from the previous quarter, which also saw an all-time-high. In fact, Livepeer\u2019s network usage achieved all-time-highs in each of the last six quarters, demonstrating a healthy demand for Livepeer video transcoding services.\n\nThis growth has the potential to continue. Increased demand for Livepeer transcoding services may come from Web3-enabled video applications, e.g., video NFT minting or token-gated access to streaming. Livepeer aims to further increase its protocol usage for 4k video and expand into other business verticals, as discussed in the \u201cRoadmap: Beyond Transcoding\u201d section.\n\nNetwork Revenue\n\nNode operators ensure that the supply of video transcoding services meets the demand of applications. Delegators help route work to the most effective nodes by committing stake to node operators. In addition, supply-side revenue in Livepeer consists of revenue from fees for transcoding services and from staking rewards.\n\nTranscoding Revenue\n\nFees from transcoding services are paid to node operators in ETH and distributed to transcoders, node operators, and delegators. As node operators stake more LPT, they increase their likelihood of receiving more work, which results in earning more transcoding fees. Delegators assign their stake to node operators, as a quality assurance mechanism that routes work to effective nodes.\n\nLivepeer transcoding fee revenue increased by 22% in ETH terms in Q1 2022. This growth in service fee revenue directly corresponds to the growth in the Livepeer network usage. However, due to the overall market downturn, the USD equivalent of the transcoding fee revenue in Q1 2022 ($136,000) decreased 13% relative to Q4 2021 ($154,000). That said, it is still 84% higher than Q3 2021 ($74,000).\n\nDespite the recent growth, transcoding revenue is relatively insignificant compared to staking reward revenue (as discussed below). Like other Web3 infrastructure protocols, the Livepeer network subsidizes its node operators with LPT rewards. This subsidization enables the Livepeer protocol to compete with existing transcoding providers like Amazon and Google.\n\nAs per Messari\u2019s recent analysis of Web3 infrastructure revenue, Livepeer\u2019s transcoding fee revenue can be evaluated according to its total addressable market: while still relatively small, transcoding revenue is growing proportionally with usage. Considering the steady growth in the number of transcoded minutes, Livepeer is well-positioned in a market with significant upside potential.\n\nStaking Revenue\n\nTo provide transcoding services on the Livepeer network, node operators must stake LPT. In turn, Livepeer distributes rewards in LPT to node operators and delegators.\n\nStaking reward revenue in LPT terms increased 17% in Q1 2022. However, due to the overall market downturn, the USD equivalent of the staking reward revenue in Q1 2022 ($15 million) decreased 12% relative to Q4 2021 ($16.7 million). Even so, it is still 108% higher than Q3 2021 ($7.2 million). Interestingly, March 2022 (199,000 LPT rewarded) posed a 23% increase relative to February 2022 (161,000 LPT).\n\nLPT staking reward issuance is dynamic: it\u2019s based on the participation rate, which is the percentage of the circulating supply that is staked. If the participation rate falls below 50% in a given round, LPT inflation increases by 0.00005%, incentivizing tokenholders to commit stake to the Livepeer network. Conversely, if participation passes 50%, inflation decreases by 0.00005%.\n\nOur previous quarterly report found that the Livepeer network had managed to incentivize network participants to approach the equilibrium of 50% participation. A follow-up question is whether this pattern holds after the network\u2019s migration to Arbitrum in mid-February 2022, upon node operators and delegators moving their stake to Layer-2.\n\nDuring the migration, a sharp drop occurred, followed by a rebound to near 50% participation. The sharp drop in the participation rate was accompanied by an increase of 23% in LPT token issuance inflation in March 2022 (0.8%) versus February 2022 (0.65%).\n\nShould the participation rate continue to stabilize at or below 50%, inflationary issuance will gradually increase.\n\nPost-Migration Takeaways\n\nLivepeer\u2019s migration to Arbitrum was successful in several ways. Prior to the migration, nodes needed to attract over 50,000 staked LPT with a reward cut of at least 25% to reach profitability. The migration has allowed for increased flexibility, as seen in the change in the frequency of delegator staking/unstaking.\n\nThe Arbitrum migration took place in round #2466, marking 6,569 moved stake. Excluding round #2466, exactly 100 rounds took place throughout Q1 2022: 49 Ethereum rounds before the migration (average moved stake: 120 per Ethereum round), and 50 Arbitrum rounds after the migration (average moved stake: 9,312 per Arbitrum round).\n\nHowever, rounds #2476 to #2496 on Arbitrum had an average of 17,961 moved stake per round, which is 93% higher than the post-migration average moved stake between February 16 and March 31 2022. After round #2496, the movements begin to settle down. This settling down could signal the return to normal activity after an initial \u201cmoving rush\u201d following the migration.\n\nTo account for this \u201cmoving rush,\u201d we compare the last full month of operation on Ethereum (January \u2013 average moved stake: 120 per Ethereum round) to the first full month on Arbitrum (March \u2013 average moved stake: 7,179 per Arbitrum round). Although a bleed of the initial spike in Arbitrum movement occurs into the start of March, there\u2019s a 60x increase in moved stake.\n\nThis increase might be explained by the lower transaction fees per operation on Arbitrum: allowing stake to be routed through the network, serving its purpose of being delegated to reliable network operators. What\u2019s more, network users saw an immediate increase in profitability. Since the migration, operating on the network has become feasible for smaller players as fees have reduced by ~97%.\n\nLivepeer Ecosystem: Notable Events\n\n$20 Million Series B-1\n\nLivepeer Inc. raised a $20 million B-1 series in January 2022. In line with the company\u2019s plans to progressively decentralize, this funding will be used for initiatives that increase functionality and serve a larger number of video applications. Altogether, Livepeer Inc. has raised $51 million to support ecosystem growth since its inception in Q3 2019.\n\nArbitrum Migration\n\nOvercoming rising Ethereum gas fees has been a key concern for Livepeer. Claiming fees and staking rewards has cut into supply-side revenue, negatively impacting existing network participants and network operator traction. Livepeer\u2019s backward incompatible migration to Arbitrum went live with the Confluence upgrade on February 14, 2022. Since then, more than half of the total LPT supply has migrated to Layer-2. Inflationary rewards are now minted, and ETH fees are solely distributed on Arbitrum.\n\nExpanding Community Presence\n\nTo stimulate network usage demand, Livepeer has sponsored various hackathons such as Web3con, NFTHack, and ETHRio. Q1 2022 saw a total of 72 projects funded to build Livepeer-enabled apps and services.\n\nNotable projects include a token-gated streaming service (Glitch), a Web3 video library (LensTube), a decentralized Twitch (Imbue), and a livestream video NFT minting platform (ColorPixels). These projects join other operational video applications that leverage the Livepeer network including DJ streaming service PlayDJ and live shopping video solutions powered by Korkuma.\n\nFurther funds have been granted to builders of tooling for node operators, staking, and governance. An additional $250,000 grants program focused on driving network demand is planned for Q2 2022.\n\nRoadmap\n\nThe Q2 2022 roadmap includes several technical and product upgrades aimed to decrease network-wide transcoding latency as well as to explore opportunities beyond transcoding.\n\nTechnical and Product Updates\n\nTo decrease verification latency, Livepeer\u2019s Fast Verification Procedure, partially implemented in Q4 2021, will roll out fully in Q2 2022. The Fast Verification Procedure aims to streamline the process of verifying that videos are transcoded appropriately by easing the verification burden on applications.\n\nThe introduction of network-wide fast verification is paving the way to increase or entirely remove the present orchestrator limit of 100 nodes, allowing more participants to verifiably contribute work on the network. Later, Full Verification will complement Fast Verification by reintroducing network slashing and on-chain dispute resolution mechanisms.\n\nIn terms of user experience, the Livepeer Explorer is expected to expand usage and performance metrics as well as optimize the stake routing experience between node operators.\n\nBeyond Transcoding\n\nLivepeer is looking to expand its service offering to include more use cases for GPUs beyond video transcoding. In 2022, Livepeer plans to introduce object recognition and scene classification capabilities.\n\nObject recognition can offer e-commerce experiences through features like automatically recognizing in-video entities, making them clickable, and enhancing them with metadata. Scene classification algorithms that classify and tag specific types of content, such as violent or adult content, can help with content moderation. Looking forward, video fingerprinting and song title recognition are additional use cases for Livepeer, which may use NFTs to prove ownership of video content and help mitigate potential copyright infringement.\n\nClosing Summary\n\nLivepeer aims to become the video infrastructure layer for both Web3 and traditional applications. To achieve this goal, Livepeer is refining and expanding its support for video services beyond transcoding. At the same time, Livepeer is considering stablecoin payments and ways that it can support cross-chain demand. Should Livepeer succeed at onboarding sufficient demand interest and decreasing overall transcoding latency, they stand a chance to become a prominent infrastructure player for video streaming services.\n\nThis report was commissioned by Livepeer, a member of Protocol Services.

They can do anything from providing exposure to asymmetric bets to implementing unique risk management strategies. As crypto amasses more institutional interest, derivatives products have taken a front and center position amongst the technological innovations within the space.\n\nCrypto exchanges have been at the forefront of derivatives products innovation. They started with BitMEX introducing funding-fee-based perpetual swaps and developed into today's decentralized exchanges (DEXs) reshaping trader and investor participation. As exchanges continue to evolve, DEXs can become the cornerstone of these advancements by leveraging the innovative mechanisms introduced by decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols.\n\nAbout Deri Protocol\n\nIntroduction to the DPMM\n\nDPMM and Tokenized Positions\n\nDeri Protocol is a derivatives DEX first introduced by Dfactory Ltd. in February 2021 that has been pushing the technological innovation of derivatives in the DeFi ecosystem. The platform architecture is based on the proactive market-making (PMM) mechanism, first introduced by DODO. The PMM uses a virtual order book to offer an increased capital efficiency compared to a traditional automated market maker (AMM) mechanism such as Uniswap\u2019s. The PMM mimics the functions of a traditional order-book-based centralized exchange (CEX) by allowing liquidity providers (LPs) to execute trades against the virtual order book. Therefore, the PMM ultimately aims to reduce the amount of impermanent loss and price slippage witnessed in traditional AMMs.\n\nDeri\u2019s main goal is to continue improving its platform\u2019s capital efficiency. As such, Deri introduced the Deri proactive market-making (DPMM) mechanism, an altered version of a traditional PMM. The DPMM architecture was first integrated in Q4 2021 and since then has received network architecture updates which are outlined in this report and are the basis for the Deri V3 upgrades.\n\nSignificance of NFTs in the DPMM\n\nThe DPMM architecture relies heavily on the tokenization of traders\u2019 positions in the form of composable NFTs. In order for information pertaining to each position to be easily stored and transferred between Deri and third-party DeFi protocols, trader positions are tokenized in the form of NFTs. Users can also trade and provide liquidity with multiple types of base tokens as collateral and/or settlement across the various products on the Deri platform.\n\nIntroduction to Deri V3 Upgrades\n\nAs previously mentioned, Deri\u2019s main focus is to increase capital efficiency for its users. The project team has made significant upgrades to its network architecture and provided new products on its platform with the Deri V3 upgrade. Upgrades to the DPMM architecture include:\n\nUniform DPMM: The DPMM network architecture has been updated to allow for any funding-fee-based derivatives to be handled by a single liquidity pool.\nThe Vault and external custody: The Vault or Money Market Protocol is an external custodian in the form of a smart contract in order to retain the real-time balance of a user\u2019s capital consisting of multiple base tokens.\nGreek-based Everlasting Options: Deri has upgraded its Everlasting Options product from a margin-based algorithm to a Greek-based margin system. This change mitigates the small chance a user\u2019s position is liquidated due to discrepancies between margin requirements and profit increments when price changes favorably to a position.\nPower Perpetuals derivatives: Deri has also added a new product to its platform named Power Perpetuals. It allows users to trade the exponent of the price of an asset and hedge against impermanent loss.\n\nDeri V3 Upgrade: Impact and Purpose\n\nDPMM Architecture Change\n\nUniform DPMM trading pools\n\nMainly, Deri has simplified the DPMM network architecture by providing a single liquidity pool for its perpetual futures and Everlasting Options products. Before, the DPMM relied on separate smart contracts/liquidity pools to settle trades for individual derivatives types. However, in order for the platform to scale and support additional base tokens, the DPMM has been upgraded to allow for any funding-fee-based derivatives to be handled by a single liquidity pool.\n\nIn the past, the DPMM relied on separate smart contracts/liquidity pools to settle trades for individual derivatives types. This approach can be too complicated for the platform to scale and support additional base tokens. As a result, Deri simplified the DPMM network architecture by providing a single liquidity pool for its perpetual futures and everlasting options products. This upgrade allows for any funding-fee-based derivatives to be handled by one liquidity pool.\n\nThe removal of separate liquidity pools based on derivatives types allows for users to trade multiple derivatives of the same underlying asset simultaneously. With this simplification, traders can view all the risk variables associated with their position, such as the Greeks (Gamma, Delta, etc.), and manage speculation and risk strategies much more simply.\n\nHowever, the implications of the DPMM upgrade go far beyond bolstering capital efficiency for traders. The simplification also allows for additional experimentation with new derivatives types on the DPMM. By leveraging composability, new derivatives can be plugged into existing DPMM trading pools where users can immediately interact with them. In this way, Deri has developed a platform where innovative derivatives products can be live-tested with other derivatives on the upgraded DPMM. Users can use these features to further innovate on ways to use derivatives products in their portfolio management strategies.\n\n  \nSource: Deri Whitepaper\n\nThe Vault\n\nDeri also introduced the Vault, a smart contract within the DPMM that interacts with external custodians. In order for Deri to properly secure user funds in a decentralized manner, the team chose to introduce external custody for user capital deposited on Deri.\n\nIn order to achieve this, the team decided to use established money market protocols as external custodians such as Compound and/or AAVE (for ERC-20 assets) and Venus (for BEP-20 assets). This way, Deri minimizes the risk of potential internal custody issues (centralization and security risks) and leverages trustworthy protocols to secure user funds while maintaining Deri\u2019s decentralized characteristics.\n\nHow the Vault Works\n\nWhen a user first deposits capital on Deri, either to provide margin or liquidity, a unique Vault is deployed for that user. Since Deri supports a multi-base-token network, the total dynamic effective value of each user's capital must be known in order to process and calculate user transactions and trades appropriately. Therefore, the Vault sends the capital to the money market protocol where the total dynamic effective value of the capital can be calculated. This calculation is possible due to the money market protocol\u2019s ability to support multiple tokens on its platform and produce the calculation for each user.\n\nWith the integration of the Vault protocol, Deri can accurately pull the data of each user\u2019s multi-base-token balance and retain real-time effective value, which further facilitates capital efficiency on the platform.\n\n  \n\nSource: Deri Whitepaper\n\nGreek-based Margin System for Everlasting Options:\n\nUp until now, Deri utilized a margin-based algorithm for its Everlasting Options products. In order to cover the loss of a position when the underlying price has changed unfavorably, the proper margin requirement is applied by the algorithm to cover the loss. However, the Deri team recognized that this traditional method isn't efficient when it comes to non-linear derivatives such as options.\n\nThe risk Deri identified is related to a scenario where the underlying asset price moves favorably to a position. In this situation, if the margin required to maintain the options position is increased, the increase cannot be greater than the increase in profit. If this were to occur, the margin requirement would surpass the profit increase, triggering the liquidation of the position.\n\nIn order to avoid this scenario, Deri integrated a Greek-based margin system for Everlasting Options.\n\n\u201cThe Greeks\u201d refers to the risk characteristics of a derivatives contract. Deri utilizes two of these, mainly Delta and Gamma:\n\nDelta (first-order derivative): the rate of change between the price of a derivative and a $1 change in the price of the underlying asset.\nGamma (second-order derivative): the rate of change between the Delta of a derivative and the price of the underlying asset.\n\nThe Greeks allow the protocol to estimate the rate of change of the options position value due to the price change of the underlying asset. With this information, margin can be appropriately increased to the options position without surpassing the increase of the underlying price and avoiding the position\u2019s liquidation.\n\nPower Perpetuals\n\nOne of Deri\u2019s new products introduced in the V3 upgrade is the Power Perpetual. The concept was first introduced by Paradigm in August 2021 and introduces new methods for traders to manage risk and speculate on crypto assets. Power Perpetuals essentially represent the exponent of an underlying asset. For example, the Power Perpetuals of BTC are represented as BTC^2, BTC^3, etc. This new type of derivative offers options-like exposure without the time constraints associated with expiration and strike prices.\n\nDeri\u2019s integrated Power Perpetuals contracts provide an asymmetric advantage to longs by boosting their upside profit and mitigating downside loss. This occurs because the change in price for the Power Perpetual is far greater than the associated increase in the price of the underlying asset. If BTC doubles, BTC^2 increases 4x, BTC^3 increases 8x, and so forth. However, if the price were to drop, the relative loss to Power Perpetual longs is far less than the potential upside. This dynamic is called \u201cpositive convexity\u201d and provides asymmetric advantages to Power Perpetual holders.\n\nThe inverse is true for users that choose to short Power Perpetuals: the losses in comparison to the gains if price increases are not favorable. However, to balance the disadvantage for short positions, traders that are long Power Perpetuals must always pay a funding fee to shorts. For Power Perpetuals, longs are the only positions that payout funding to short positions. It should be noted that users only have to pay funding once they\u2019ve opened a long position.\n\nHedging Impermanent Loss with Power Perpetuals\n\nAnother use case Deri has adopted for Power Perpetuals is hedging against impermanent loss. Impermanent loss refers to the relative losses accepted by LPs due to price fluctuations of the tokens they\u2019ve provided. However, losses are realized only when LPs withdraw tokens from dual-asset liquidity pools.\n\nLP tokens also have a Delta and Gamma risk exposure to their underlying assets; however, Gamma, the second-order derivative, complicates the ways in which traders can hedge. This is where Power Perpetuals come into play. Due to Power Perpetual\u2019s positive convexity feature, the Gamma associated with the contract is positive. Therefore, the exposure to Gamma risk is minimized, introducing a Gamma neutral position.\n\nThis position could not be achieved with a traditional, linear derivative such as a futures contract, because the futures position would need to be continually rebalanced in order to mitigate Gamma risk for LPs.\n\nFurthermore, LPs must also hedge against Delta risk exposure. Therefore, a short position on a linear futures contract of the underlying asset is required to ensure Delta risk neutrality. Deri has provided an example of how this can work in their most recent announcement:\n\nSource: Deri Medium\n\nDeri\u2019s Power Perpetual platform officially launched on March 14, 2022, and hosts up to 18 unique base tokens mentioned in the most recent Deri Telegram AMA.\n\nTraction\n\nAlthough Deri was affected by the general crypto market drawdown, its total value locked (TVL) has remained stable since Q4 2021.\n\n  \n\nThe platform has also managed to maintain an average of $70 million of daily trading volume through Q1 2022. When compared to the top derivatives DEXs, Deri has also made significant progress in maintaining user participation.\n\nRoadmap\n\nAfter the successful rollout of the Deri V3 upgrade and Power Perpetuals integration, Deri continues to innovate and provide nuanced financial instruments.  \n\nThe team continues to add new base tokens for its perpetual futures and Everlasting Options products. Across Ethereum, BNB Smart Chain, and Polygon, the project now offers around 26 unique base tokens for users to trade and stake on Deri\u2019s platform. The project also plans to integrate additional governance privileges for DERI holders. Users will be able to vote on and propose asset management strategies and ecosystem fund allocation for DeFi-based projects/products integrated with Deri.\n\nFinally, the team has announced it will provide a Deri V4 upgrade in Q4 2022. Providing multichain liquidity will be the main feature integration to the existing DPMM for this upgrade.\n\nConclusion\n\nDespite the uncertainty in crypto markets this year, Deri keeps humming along. It has not only maintained its user activity, but it has also continued to integrate innovative products with the DPMM. DEXs have played a key role in structuring the way DeFi has evolved up until now and can be considered the gateway products for the majority of crypto retail investors. Deri hasn\u2019t missed a beat since the publishing of the introductory report and is showing no signs of stopping from becoming a significant competitor in the derivatives DEX sector.\n\n  \n\nThis report was commissioned by Deri Protocol, a member of Protocol Services.

It aims to accomplish this through a novel timestamp mechanism called Proof-of-History (PoH). Using PoH, the network can order and batch transactions before they\u2019re processed through a separate Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus. Additional design goals include sub-second settlement times, low transaction costs, and support for all LLVM-compatible smart contract languages, including Rust, C, and C++.\n\nAs the first edition of quarterly coverage of Solana, this report will highlight important developments over the prior year and the network's most recent quarterly performance. A full appendix of data tables is available at the end of the report.\n\nThe Narrative\n\nSeveral Layer-1 networks reported high growth rates in 2021, including Solana. With the rollout of bridge infrastructures like Wormhole and Allbridge, billions of dollars migrated into the Solana ecosystem. Self custody solutions like the Phantom Wallet enabled millions of users to self-custody their assets further adding to growth. Other growth drivers included high profile partnerships (i.e. FTX, Circle) and incentive programs focused on DeFi, GameFi, and Web3. As users and developers entered the ecosystem, Solana recorded all-time-highs in daily users, transactions, revenue, minted NFTs, total value locked (TVL), and market capitalization. Still, it was unclear how the network would fare in 2022 after experiencing network performance issues during the latter half of 2021.\n\nUltimately, Q1 2022 consisted of continued growth in some respects but challenges and declines in others. Despite volatility across some metrics, stabilization of network usage, financial performance, and network infrastructure occured by the end of the quarter. Several developments accounted for the Q1 results, including new NFTs and growing NFT markets that reached billion-dollar sales volume; the diversification of TVL across DeFi applications; improvements in UX such as the Phantom mobile wallet; and the launch of new applications across several sectors other than DeFi.\n\nSolana\u2019s success in the second half of 2021 brought on growing pains that carried over into Q1. In February, the ecosystem experienced an exploit of the Wormhole bridge that resulted in the loss of 120,000 ETH (subsequently replenished) and further instances of degraded network performance throughout the quarter.\n\nThe Solana team prioritized the development of mitigation strategies to prevent future issues. They also continued to execute on growth strategies to ensure continued adoption heading into Q2.\n\nNetwork Overview\n\nSolana experienced mixed trends across network and financial metrics compared to the prior quarter. While market cap and revenue declined by 30% and 43.5%, respectively, the network experienced continued uptrends in usage, quantified by average active unique fee payers (+28.4%), average transactions per second (+94.8%), and total average daily transactions (+4.2%). Intuitively, the decline in revenue generation (measured by user expenditure on transactions) mirrored the decline in average transaction fees (-44.8%). Degraded network performance also put significant downward pressure on revenue, as daily revenue saw sharp declines during network congestion.\n\nBecause revenue declined faster than market cap, the price-to-sales (P/S) ratio trended upward, moving from 676x to 991x. Unlike last quarter, network usage continued to grow while financial performance declined.\n\nThe \u201cdaily unique fee payers\u201d metric consists of the number of unique accounts that pay for at least one transaction per day. Network usage continued upward as unique fee payers reached an all-time-high of 280,000 in January. For perspective, Solana had more unique fee payers during January than in all of Q3 2021, when the network also experienced triple-digit percentage growth in market cap and revenue. The network averaged around 160,000 unique fee payers during Q4 and stabilized at about 205,000 during Q1. The growth in unique fee payers is consistent with the growth in NFTs and NFT sales, application launches, and growth in transactions.\n\nTransactions on Solana can be divided into two categories: 1) consensus and 2) token transfers and smart contract logic. Solana\u2019s PoS consensus process is unlike other smart contract platforms because its votes for consensus are registered as on-chain events. Non-vote transactions are analogous to EVM transaction counts and represent the actual economic activity on the network.\n\nLike Q4, total transaction activity on the network followed a similar pattern to daily unique fee payer growth. It only deviated due to the anomalies related to degraded network performance seen in the early and middle part of January. Solana's average daily voting transactions rose from ~152 million last quarter to ~163 million in Q1. However, average daily non-vote transactions declined from ~45 million last quarter to ~39 million.\n\nIf the number of validators on the network increased (which it did over Q1), then the number of vote transactions would go up, even if non-vote transactions remained constant. As highlighted later in this report, the Solana DeFi ecosystem contracted during the quarter, likely contributing to the decline in non-vote transactions. On the aggregate, however, total daily transactions continued their upward trend as validator count expanded.\n\nAs daily unique signers and total transactions grew, cumulative revenue decelerated after declines in daily revenue. Cumulative revenue became a more significant fraction of the network's fully diluted market value (FDV), despite quarterly revenue decreasing by 43.5%. For perspective, cumulative revenue as a percentage of FDV is 15 times what it was last year, signaling that fundamentals like network usage and revenue are moving more in line with market value.\n\nAlthough fundamental metrics are becoming a greater portion of market value, the question is just how statistically significant the spread between fundamentals and market value is. With that in mind, as fundamental value (as opposed to speculative value) becomes a more substantial part of market value, a strong correlation between fundamental usage and market value may exist.\n\nMost notably, the volatility and trend of daily revenue are generally accompanied by movements in FDV. The same relationship exists between circulating market cap and price. Additionally, the spread between daily revenue and FDV tightened during Q1, with occasional spikes and declines in revenue accompanied by spikes and declines in FDV. Again, this correlation could indicate that the network moved closer to its fundamental value than speculative value.\n\nIf the relationship holds, then fundamentals may have a significant relationship with market value, otherwise also interpreted as network value. Therefore, an area of concern related to this relationship is network reliability. As seen in 2021 and throughout Q1, degraded network performance decreases network usage and therefore reduces the network\u2019s continued flow of revenue. If Solana were to continue to experience degraded performance that lasts for any material amount of time, it would appear that a resulting drag on fundamental usage may catalyze volatility and drag on network value.\n\nSince April 2021, engaged stake and staking yields have been stable, with an average annualized yield of ~6%. If the engaged stake were to experience volatility, so too would yield, but the engaged stake on Solana has been strong and stable at ~75% over the last year. The stability of engaged stake mitigates network value volatility to some extent and is favorable for the distribution of stake and decentralization as more validators and delegators come online.\n\nEcosystem & Development Overview\n\nHeading into 2022, Solana DeFi experienced declines in TVL (-29.6%), much like many other Layer-1s but at a rate about twice the rate of the top chains by TVL. With that in mind, mitigation strategies were put in place to mitigate the contraction of its DeFi economy. One such strategy came from Serum, the central limit order book that underpins much of DeFi on Solana. Serum announced a $100 million fundraising in January to expand its operations.\n\nUnlike DeFi sector, the Solana NFT market continued its accelerated growth after an exponential Q4. This growth was fueled by the number of new projects, secondary sales volume, and unique NFT buyers. In aggregate, Solana NFT total sales volume crossed $1 billion in the middle of January.\n\nTVL might have declined more drastically if not for the horizontal expansion of the DeFi sector. Solana\u2019s total DeFi ecosystem decline was less intense than the top DeFi protocols Marinade Finance (38%), Serum (39%), and Raydium (53%). Their collective TVL declined by 44% \u2014 more than 15% greater than Solana\u2019s entire TVL decline. This suggests that the development of smaller protocols in the DeFi ecosystem offset the market forces negatively impacting the other protocols\u2019 TVL. Nonetheless, TVL appears to have stabilized at ~$7 billion heading into Q2.\n\nThe launch of the Serum DeFi incentive program and the growth of emerging DeFi protocols stabilized the sector by the end of the quarter. Solend TVL grew by 33%, moving it up to second place. Meanwhile, the fastest-growing DeFi protocol that worked its way into the top 10 was Lido, growing by 82% over the quarter.\n\nThe other notable trend across Q1 was the steady long tail of DeFi protocols on Solana with at least $1 million TVL. Entering Q1, 30 protocols had amassed $1 million TVL, up from just 17 from the prior quarter. Exiting Q1, 35 protocols maintained the $1 million TVL mark. Despite the down quarter, the diversification of TVL remains healthy, with the \u201cother\u201d category making up 50%. In addition, the number of applications with recorded TVL grew from 40 to 60, representing a 50% increase in its DeFi foundation.\n\nFollowing a breakout Q4 2021, Solana NFT activity retained its strength amidst the network\u2019s decline in DeFi activity. Daily new NFTs maintained a quarterly level of almost 5 million new NFTs and grew by 2.6% over the quarter. For perspective, newly minted NFTs reached 85% of the amount minted during 2021. Further traction could be seen in total sales volume crossing $1 billion by mid-January and Metaplex minting 2,000 NFTs per hour by February. By the end of the quarter, Solana became the second-largest protocol by secondary NFT sales volume, trailing only behind Ethereum.\n\nAnother indicator of ecosystem development is the number of unique programs used in a given time period. The unique program metric represents applications with at least one successful instruction per day, based on a single program address. The number of unique programs used has grown steadily each month as more applications launch and grow their user base.\n\nEvents in Solana Lab\u2019s Github repository continued to grow (34.2%) quarter over quarter. Though in a monthly downtrend, the quarterly number of events indicates that the network\u2019s core is collectively stronger than in prior quarters.\n\nStaking and Decentralization Overview\n\nThe security of PoS networks like Solana requires users to lock up the network\u2019s native tokens and participate in validation duties. The distributed network of validators and active participants ensures that the network functions as intended.\n\nAs mentioned earlier in this report, the average engaged stake on Solana has held strong at ~75% over the last year. This stability mitigates network value volatility to some extent. The stability has also allowed network infrastructure to expand with increases in the number of validators and delegators (i.e., active stakers). Growth in infrastructure paired with a relatively flat total stake amount suggests the greater distribution of stake and therefore decentralization.\n\nStaking amounts during Q1 were relatively uneventful, with average stake changes in single-digit percentage points quarter over quarter. Such predictability and lack of volatility in the total stake amount are generally good for network health.\n\nWhile the average staking amount was relatively flat, there was a material increase in the average number of validators and delegators. The average validator count grew from 1,255 to 1,579, representing a 25.8% increase in network security participants.\n\nThe average number of delegators grew significantly from 426,370 to 654,279, representing a 53.5% increase. When it comes to Solana, delegators are referred to as active stakers, measured by the number of accounts that received staking awards. Because the majority of wallets only have one stake account, delegator count is a rough indication of the number of individuals staking.\n\nThe Nakamoto coefficient is a metric first introduced by Balaji Srinivasan to quantify the decentralization of blockchain networks. The coefficient represents the minimum number of colluding actors necessary to disrupt the network. For Solana, the Nakamoto coefficient equals the number of validators that control one third of the network\u2019s stake.\n\nSolana\u2019s Nakamoto coefficient hovered in the low teens to begin 2021 but improved to 19 by the end of the year. With the growth in validator count and stability in total amount staked, the coefficient has improved further and remained stable at 20, putting Solana above a peer group average of 10 when compared to other Layer-1 networks.\n\nCompetitive Analysis\n\nCurrently, the Layer-1 space is a competitive race between new and legacy protocols to be the fastest, cheapest, and most secure network. Each competitor has focused on maximizing these activities while making a range of trade-offs regarding centralization. The ideal blockchain would be fast, secure, widely used, and adequately decentralized.\n\nTechnical advancements, core developer activity (Solana is leading its peer group), and ecosystem growth strategies may separate one L1 from another in terms of network usage and financial performance. Here, we evaluate Solana\u2019s progress versus the top five Layer-1s by TVL (including Solana). The methodology used to derive this peer group is simply by grouping the top five chains with the largest TVL, seeing as today, DeFi is the sector driving the majority of each network\u2019s economic activity.\n\nSolana experienced the greatest decline in market cap compared to the peer group. Much of the market value decline occurred during times of degraded network performance. Following its network performance issues, network value stabilized and began to trend upward, allowing Solana to return to a market cap position ahead of Terra by the end of the quarter.\n\nSimilarly, Solana\u2019s daily revenue trended downward and experienced volatility in January. The peer group also experienced declines, with the exception of Avalanche.\n\nSolana\u2019s P/S ratio increased over the quarter, as did all other chains except for Avalanche. Because Solana experienced a greater market value (i.e., price) decline and a similar decline in revenue (i.e., sales), the increase in P/S was not as significant as Ethereum and BNB Chain.\u00a0 From a relative valuation perspective, Solana is now more in line with Terra with a P/S of 990x versus Terra\u2019s 1,865x. The rest of the peer group ranges between 80x and 125x.\n\nQ1 was a flat to down quarter for the crypto market, with aggregate TVL decreasing from $240 billion to $230 billion. Solana\u2019s TVL declined at the fastest rate among the top Layer-1s. A significant portion of Solana\u2019s decline benefited Terra and Avalanche, separating further from Solana in terms of TVL. Solana began to reverse course and trend upward at the end of the quarter. The Solana Mcap/TVL ratio also ended among the highest at 5x, trailing only behind BNB Chain\u2019s 5.4x.\n\nSolana continued its path to establishing a strong position relative to a peer group of the top L1s by secondary NFT sales volume. While Avalanche played catch-up, Solana further separated from longer-term NFT platforms Ronin, Flow, and Polygon.\n\n  \nThough Ethereum still dominates roughly 85% of the secondary NFT market, Solana\u2019s position as the second-largest by sales volume is a bright spot when evaluating Q1.\n\nSimilarly, Solana continued its path to attracting unique buyers and establishing a strong position nearing levels similar to Ethereum and Flow.\n\nKey Events, Catalysts, and Strategies for Ecosystem Growth\n\nWhile some quantifiable data suggest a slow down in some areas of the Solana economy, significant qualitative efforts through growth strategies, product launches, and improvements in user access and experience (UX) pushed the network forward. Several qualitative aspects may provide further insight into why the Solana network and ecosystem experienced what it did over the quarter and why it may be well-positioned for continued adoption heading into Q2.\n\nJanuary 2022\n\nIn January, there were advances in user access and experience. Moonpay, a money services application for buying and selling crypto, announced its support for USDC, the most popular stablecoin on Solana. Further, a new version of the Unity-Solana wallet was rolled out, which featured password encryption and NFT loading optimization. Shortly after this development, WalletConnect, an emerging protocol for connecting wallets and applications, announced support for Solana. Major UX advancements wrapped up with the most widely-used wallet on Solana, the Phantom Wallet, releasing support for mobile compatibility. Coinbase announced support for Solana SPL tokens on that same day, signaling accelerated access to the Solana ecosystem through Coinbase.\n\nIn addition to advancements in UX, several growth strategies and partnerships enabled the expansion of application launches across different sectors. Heading into 2022, Solana Ventures' $150 million fund to boost GamFi was underway. Similarly, Serum announced plans to raise $100 million to expand operations. At the same time, Visa announced the onboarding of its first Solana-based project Zebtec, a payroll protocol, to its Fintech Fast Track program. Lastly, G2 Esports, a popular esports platform, announced its collaboration with Metaplex to offer NFTs for various uses across the platform.\n\nBy the end of January, additional strategies for growth were put in place with the Solana Hacker House World Tour and the Riptide Global Hackathon. The World Tour was a series of six-week-long hacker houses around the globe aimed at all levels of development on Solana. Paired with Hacker Houses and sponsors like Visa and Google, Riptide organized a hackathon with $5 million in prizes to be paid out to successful development efforts across multiple tracks such as Web3 and gaming.\n\nIn addition, a number of new applications were launched. The GameFi sector ushered in launches of applications like Wasder, Trash Pandas, and MechaFightClub, while Web3 brought launches of messaging application 4thTech and social platform Rally.io. Rally.io is a leading Ethereum-based platform for creators to launch their social tokens. It plans to use Solana to launch projects that tap into the RLY Network. Lastly, the Solana network also made strides in the stablecoin space with the launch of UXD Protocol (UXD), an algorithmic stablecoin, and Hubble Protocol (USDH), a censorship-resistant stablecoin.\n\nUltimately, it was an eventful January, filled with advances in UX and a series of growth strategies.\n\nFebruary 2022\n\nFebruary followed suit with additional advancements in UX, growth strategies, and product launches. Most notably, the launch of Solana Pay,\u00a0 a protocol for merchant payments, was announced on February 1. Within days, Solana Pay received 325+ inbound leads from across the globe and witnessed over 70 forks on GitHub. In addition to Solana Pay, UX also advanced with the announcement of the 1Password partnership with Phantom Wallet to create a simpler, more secure way to manage assets on the Solana blockchain.\n\nWhile over 1,100 builders worldwide registered for the Riptide Hackathon to compete for prizes & seed funding, the NFT marketplace was back on the scene in February. Music and arts festival Coachella introduced the Coachella Collectibles NFTs intended for lifetime festival passes and digital collectibles redeemable for physical items. Further, Project Galaxy, a collaborative credential infrastructure for Web3, announced a $1 million prize pool for an NFT treasure hunt campaign across 27 different protocols on Solana.\n\nAs was the case in January, several anticipated project launches took place across various sectors including NFTs, GameFi, and Web3. Burnt Finance announced its launch and is the first protocol on Solana to enable users to buy, sell, trade, and mint NFTs on a decentralized protocol. The protocol intends to release a number of DeFi functionalities that will allow NFTs to be used for liquidity, fractionalization, and GameFi. STEPN, a move-to-earn app officially went live on the Apple iOS store in February. Shortly after, Audius, a decentralized music platform, announced its anticipated launch of the AUDIO token and rewards for taking in-app actions such as completing profiles, uploading, inviting friends, and listening streaks.\n\nThrough February, advances in UX continued, more access to the ecosystem was enabled, and growth strategies continued to usher in use cases that went beyond DeFi.\n\nMarch 2022\n\nDown the final stretch of Q1, the Solana growth strategy brought more improvements in UX and significant moves to expand the NFT marketplace and additional product launches across sectors.\n\nOn March 1, FTX and Bonfida teamed up and announced that users could directly withdraw from FTX using their .sol domain name. This advancement removes the barrier of unreadable wallet addresses through the Solana Name Service (SNS), powered by Bonfida. By the end of the first week of March, further advancements on Solana Pay were announced with the rollout of mtnPay, an iOS Point-of-Sale app, and its progression to the Merchant Beta phase. By the middle of March, Coinbase Wallet added support for Solana project tokens, which was announced not long after Coinbase announced support for SPL tokens at the end of January. This likely indicates that Coinbase is moving towards more Solana token listings. By the end of March, the hardware wallet Ledger announced support for Solana on Ledger Live.\n\nBefore the quarter could end, Magic Eden, the largest NFT marketplace based on Solana, announced it had raised $27 million in a Series A funding round. Paradigm led the round, with Sequoia Capital, Solana Ventures, Greylock Partners, Electric Capital, and others participating.\n\nAnother major indicator of the continued growth of the Solana NFT market came from OpenSea, which announced support would be coming for Solana NFTs in April. OpenSea is the largest NFT marketplace in the industry, hosting markets primarily for Ethereum-based NFTs. Lastly, Serum and Burnt Finance were back in the headlines when Serum introduced the Serum NFT Ecosystem \u2014 a series of Solana-based NFT collections that will be launched and minted using the Burnt Finance Ignition Launchpad. Collectively, it would seem that greater access and greater liquidity for Solana NFTs are on the way.\n\nWhile significant moves towards expanding the NFT sector are notable, product launches across multiple sectors continued. Solana finished out the quarter with the launch of Dialect, a dynamic, composable notification and wallet-to-wallet chat application, and Angelic, a multiplayer strategy role-playing game. Lastly, Krafton, the game maker of PUBG, a battle royale series with more than a billion downloads, announced that they will develop games on the Solana blockchain. Here again, we see continued expansion into sectors that go beyond DeFi.\n\nEcosystem Challenges\n\nAlthough the second half of 2021 was pivotal for the Solana network, it came with growing pains that carried into Q1. Network performance issues occurred on December 13, January 7, and January 21. In each instance, throughput deteriorated and resulted in a material decrease in TPS and an increase in failed transactions. As mentioned earlier, these events had a negative impact on network fundamentals that appeared to have negatively impacted network value.\n\nNonetheless, Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko subsequently shared details about the network congestion issues observed on the network. Gulfstream, Solana\u2019s alternative to the mempool for pending transactions, currently allows bots to propose an arbitrary number of transactions, forcing block producers to check all transactions before making a block. This can lead to users submitting transactions that aren't included in blocks because producers cannot process all transactions before finalizing blocks. Ultimately, as a result of bots proposing an overwhelming number of transactions, block production suffered, and the network experienced degraded performance.\n\nA network congestion mitigation strategy was also subsequently outlined. The Mainnet Beta v1.10.x series will include QUIC, a feature that will allow block producers to instruct bots to propose only a small number of transactions at a time. A block producer would be able to parse through all transactions and select the valid ones. QUIC is not intended to solve the network congestion issues alone. Fee and prioritization changes are currently in development to allow users to jump ahead of the transaction queue as transactions propagate through the network. To that end, both QUIC and a fee prioritization mechanism should mitigate the bot spamming of the network.\n\nIn addition to degraded network performance, the ecosystem experienced an exploit of the widely used cross-chain bridge Wormhole. On February 2, the Wormhole team stated via Twitter that the network was exploited for 120,000 wETH. An incident report was released indicating that an attacker exploited a signature verification vulnerability in the Wormhole network to mint 120,000 Wormhole-wrapped Ether on Solana. These tokens were not backed by Ether deposits on the Ethereum side of the Portal bridge. The attacker then bridged 93,750 of the tokens to Ethereum, withdrawing the unwrapped Ether from the contract. By February 3, the vulnerability was patched, and the bridge was brought back online. Further, Jump Crypto replenished the ETH contract, and the wETH/ETH backing was restored.\n\nThe Road Ahead\n\nCurrently, Solana does not maintain an updated public-facing roadmap. However, it is expected that the Solana ecosystem will continue efforts to drive growth through its growth strategies and incentives.\n\nThe core platform upgrades are expected to continue. Solana launched its mainnet beta in March 2020. Since the beta release, the development team has been working on optimizing the network. Though still in beta, Solana has 100% functionality, even if there are pending developments. Such developments and mitigation strategies outlined by Yakovenko show what separates the network from being in beta versus a full release. With that in mind, some concerns about network performance will likely be addressed once Solana is fully released with further plans for continued risk mitigation, such as QUIC and the fee prioritization mechanisms. No date has been assigned to the full mainnet release.\n\nAnother major development involves Neon, a Solana project building a smart contract layer that utilizes the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). According to Neon, its implementation of the EVM will be able to process 4,500 TPS. This could be a significant catalyst for growth as we saw other EVM Layer-1s acquire developers, users, and considerable market share during 2021. Solana's Neon EVM is expected to launch by the end of June.\n\nClosing Summary\n\nIn some respects, Q1 2022 was a positive quarter for Solana, but it also presented some challenges. As the quarter came to a close, network usage, financial performance, and network infrastructure stabilized. Several factors contributed to the Q1 results, including the continued growth of new NFTs and NFT markets, diversification of TVL, improvements in UX, and new applications across several sectors outside of DeFi.\n\nEven though the network recorded new highs across several aspects, the ecosystem experienced an exploit of the Wormhole bridge in February and further instances of degraded network performance throughout the quarter. The core platform upgrades are expected to continue as mitigation strategies have been outlined. Once Solana is fully released, these network performance concerns should be addressed to a great extent.\n\nUltimately, despite intermittent network congestion, the ecosystem continued to execute on growth strategies and showed signs of further adoption heading into Q2. The Solana ecosystem will likely proceed with its efforts to drive growth. With developments ranging from Solana Pay and OpenSea to the Neon EVM, expansion into various sectors and a fully Ethereum-compatible environment appear to be on the horizon for Solana.\n\nAppendix\n\nThis report was commissioned by Solana, a member of Protocol Services.

You can also read the full Quarterly Report by Jerry Sun and Ashu Pareek here.\n\nParticipants:\n\nJerry Sun - Research Analyst, Messari\nAshu Pareek - Research Specialist, Messari\nDavid Gogel, Head of Growth & Operations, dYdX Foundation\nCorey Miller, Growth Lead, dYdX\nVijay Chetty, Head of Business Development, dYdX Trading\n\nJerry Sun (00:04): The dYdX team, Corey, David, Vijay, why don't you guys introduce yourselves. Maybe share a little about how you got to the dYdX team and maybe like what you guys do for the organization. And then I can introduce Ashu and I towards the end and then we can go from there.\n\nVijay Chetty (00:39): Great, happy to kick things off from the dYdX trading side. So my name is Vijay Chetty, head of business development here. Been with the team just about two years now, based in San Francisco and I've been working on a range of things from institutional business development to growth efforts and marketing. And prior to that I was in the crypto space for about six or seven years. So previously Insurance Post and Ripple. And before that, I came from Wall Street at Blackrock. It's good to be with you guys. I'll head over to Corey.  \n\nCorey Miller (1:00): Great! Yeah so this is Corey Miller, the growth lead here at dYdX. I have also been here for about two years. I'd say I'm largely responsible for things such as new user acquisition and marketing. And prior to dYdX, I was also in crypto albeit more on the investing side of things. So, that was a fund called Block Tower Capital, for a couple of years. And then prior to that, I was at a seed stage venture capital fund. Okay to David!\n\nDavid Gogel (1:36): Hey everyone, thanks for having me! My name is David Gogel. I'm the head of growth and operations at the dYdX foundation and based in Switzerland. I've been with the foundation for the last eight months or so now and focused on everything dYdX token, DAO governance related initiatives and before that I was on the growth team at dYdX trading for about a year. I have also been in the crypto space for about six years now in various roles in the investing world and then on the straight up ecosystem world in New York. Before that I got my MBA at Wharton Business School where I helped start the Penn Blockchain Club and was president of the fintech club. And then in a past life worked on Wall Street as a trader and then in M&A as well. Thanks for having me!\n\nJerry Sun (2:29): Awesome! Nice! Kind of diverse set of experiences and Penn Blockchain Club is very active in the crypto community so that's really cool. Question Vijay and Corey, you guys both are part of dYdX trading or dYdX? Just to clear up the different entities within the organization. There's the foundation and there's a trading side. Is there just dYdX or is that the same thing as trading?\n\nVijay Chetty (3:00): So dYdX trading is the US corporation behind the development of the protocol. That was a company founded by Antonio Juliano, the founder and CEO currently. And that's the team really working on the technology as well as the fully decentralized V4 version of the protocol that's upcoming. And the intent is really for that team to ship that and hand over control to the community from that point going forward. And likely continue to have a role around that decentralized ecosystem in some way assuming the community desires it and so that's really how we fit in. And then I'll let David speak more specifically to the foundation's role and how the foundation works with training but there's very much a separation of efforts there.\n\nDavid Gogel (3:54): Right, so the dYdX foundation is a completely independent organization headquartered in Zug, Switzerland. We were founded in the middle of last year and the foundation is the entity responsible for issuing the dYdX token and driving the progressive decentralization over the dYdX protocol. So, we have a separate team, a separate board of directors and a shared vision and alignment with the dYdX trading team. But really a different scope of work. So we have employees and contractors all around the world and really focus on everything, DAO token and governance related.  \n\nJerry Sun (4:49): All right! Well thank you guys for the introduction and also clearing the differences between the two. On our side, I'm Jerry and I got Ashu with me. He's also on the team. We're both research analysts on the Messari team. We wrote the state of dYdX Q1 2022 report. I've done a couple of others as well as done a couple of other calls. Sofor everyone here, we're excited to have you and I think we can kick things off and get started. Let me share my screen here and jump to. Can you guys see my screen? So I think just overall, a high level overview, I think the most important metric that we really covered in the report just from the quarter of dYdX is trading volume. At the end of the day, dYdX is an exchange. And so, users and trading volume are going to be the main metrics we want to look at to see the health of the organization and also in terms of some aspect of growth as well. And kind of in this sense, what we see is I think to be expected. Just taking a look at DEXs across the board, exchanges across the board, like Q1 kind of a pullback from Q4. I wrote about this in the report but just in general I think the crypto economy or the ecosystem as a whole went from about $3 trillion to $2 trillion. So a 50% pullback but if you look at trading volume for dYdX, a lot less of a pullback 23.8% or 24%. So I think in that sense it remains healthy and very active. Now, one of the questions I want to ask the two of you guys or the three of you guys on this call is there was a report from Max Holloway in Xenophon Labs and he's basically saying the trading volume of the protocol is heavily impacted by token price. How much do you guys consider that in terms of your rewards incentives program or just in terms of overall incentivization for trading volume?  \n\nDavid Gogel (7:31): Yeah so I'm happy to kick things off. So I guess just taking a step back right. So we launched the token and the governance contracts in July of 2021. So really that large inflection that you see from the left part of the chart to the right part of the chart is really the key catalyst for that is the token and the governance contracts which kicked off this process of decentralization for the community. And so collectively the team spent almost a year really thinking through token design, token economics and the different kinds of incentives that we were trying to drive from stakeholders in the ecosystem. And we think we built a robust ecosystem around governance rewards and staking, each of which design or were designed to drive growth and decentralization of the protocol. And so as part of that, there's two main ways to earn their token from a trading standpoint. The first is what we call the trading rewards and so that's really rewarding. Generally a combination of open interests and trading fees on the exchange and that really the largest pool of dYdX rewards is allocated to that rewards system. The second is what we call the liquidity provider rewards and so that's really trying to incentivize two-sided liquidity on the platform and rewarding a combination of factors, uptime depth, two-sided bid-ask spread and uptime on the platform as well as number of markets supported. And so that's really geared towards more professional market makers and liquidity providers who are providing liquidity to the exchange. And so both of those pools are really designed to reward both taker volume and maker volume which drive organic behavior on the exchange. There's two other kinds of ways to earn dYdX tokens. The first is through what we call the liquidity module and so this is a staking pool where stakers stake USDC and then community approved market makers borrow that capital risk-free to provide liquidity on the exchange. And then lastly there's the safety module where stakers can stake dYdX which acts as the ultimate backstop for the exchange and earn dYdX in return. And so those are the four different rewards and staking pools that we initially designed to distribute dYdX to various holders and participants within the ecosystem. There's also an allocation for a community treasury that vests monthly that funds various activities in the protocol like the dYdX grants program and then there was a very substantial retroactive rewards program that got tokens into the hands of past users of the protocol. To go back to your original question, how much do we look at token price, when thinking about these reward systems, the honest truth is we don't look at token price at all. We were very clear from day one that the current utility of the token is really around governance and really handing control of the token to our most active users on the protocol and allowing them to help shape the future of the protocol and have decision making power over many aspects of version three of their protocol and then all aspects of version four of their protocol which is slated to launch later this year. So at least internally we don't look at token price really ever. I think it's obviously probably pretty common for traders including a lot of the research that Max Holloway and team put together to try to come up with a dollar value for all of the rewards pools and staking pools that we came up with. And so I think over the last eight months or so, there's been about 130 million dYdX distributed which is a little more than 10% of the total supply of tokens to all of the rewards and staking pools that I mentioned. Obviously, the dYdX token price has been quite volatile but very much kind of trading in line with some other DeFi peers and so I think if you look at the current price of around $4 or $5, there's been about $500 million or so in value that has just been distributed to token holders over the last eight epochs or so. So those are just some metrics for framing but to go back to your question, we don't explicitly look at token price when thinking through these reward systems.\n\nJerry Sun (13:15): Right, I think that totally makes a lot of sense. One of the things covered at least you can notice from this transaction volume chart and one of the things covered in one of the discussions is the way the current incentives are set and I guess the reason I asked the question right is in a way using the token as incentives or rewards to reward traders like you talked about earlier and trading activity is one way that leads to growth of the protocol. So just focusing on the growth aspect, the way transaction volume is right now in the way I think the incentives are set, they are distributed right like every four weeks at the end of every epoch and I know there was some discussion about having maybe a more flat distribution. Maybe like whether it's distributed daily or just on a more granular level. Do you, from your guys' side and I don't know exactly kind of where that led but from your guys side, what are your thoughts on that versus kind of the current rewards incentive structures you have now?  \n\nVijay Chetty (14:34): Yeah sure, happy to take that. So this was actually like really interesting instance where the community came together to really push forward a change that made a lot of economic sense for the protocol and community in exchange as a whole and had built on a lot of thinking that the dYdX team had done going into the launch of the incentives. And so I think for us it was really gratifying to see the community step up and take that ownership and leadership to really form an opinion around the trading rewards. And so just to summarize what happened. So Max, he started an organization called the Xenophon labs and he and his team have been actively looking at the dYdX protocol incentives and what they've found at a high level and there's lots of supporting research behind this that we're happy to share as well and that's available on the forums. But what they've found is that the epoch structure for rewards leads to late stage competition going into the end of each epoch where it pays for traders to basically essentially significantly ramp up their activity and take on a lot of open interest going into the end of the epoch in order to capture an outsized share of rewards. And the reason that happens is because reward value or expected value becomes more predictable as you hit the end of the epoch because rewards are claimable approximately seven days after the end of each epoch. So as a result there's much more predictability about what the actual economic value earned is and it makes sense for players to ramp up towards the end of the epoch and they do that primarily by taking on a lot of open interest. And so Max and team analyzed the incentive in great detail and looked at historical data, did back testing, came up with sort of the optimal strategy and what they found is really that it made sense to increase the weighting on the fee parameter of the trading rewards formula. So if you look at the formula, there's component probe and interest and component for the trading fees paid which obviously is geared towards those running heavy taker strategies that consume those higher taker fees. And so Max's hypothesis was that increasing the waiting on that would lead not only to a better and essentially more fair distribution rewards based on intended behavior, but would also be better for the the exchange overall and potentially reduce the sort of late stage competition that we see going to the end of the epoch by those who are trying to gain the rewards. So all in all, the hypothesis, our hope is that this change that's going through the governance process as we speak, will help to make those trading rewards more distributed and also lead less to that gamification behavior and sort of the late stages of the epoch so both from a market fairness as well as a market integrity standpoint, it's a change that there seems to be a lot of support around and the community is really rallying behind. So we're excited to see how the rewards distribution and the trading activity evolves as that gets implemented in the coming weeks. So that's on the trading rewards side and then there's also a separate liquidity provider rewards that David was alluding to that we can cover later as well.  \n\nJerry Sun (17:54): And so when you talk about the trading rewards program, this is the one that I think there was a snapshot vote for or there was some kind of measure of interest a couple weeks back where among other things there would be more of a less of an emphasis on open interest and more of an emphasis on the fee structure aspect, right?  \n\nVijay Chetty (18:22): Exactly yeah.\n\nJerry Sun (18:23): Okay, got you.\n\nVijay Chetty (18:27): And that snapshot has passed, so it's set to be implemented.\n\nJerry Sun (18:32): Right, and I think there was another aspect of that vote where another suggestion was to go and distribute dYdX rewards in USDC versus in the native dYdX token. Is that correct and are you guys kind of able to kind of speak to that aspect of things?\n\nVijay Chetty (18:54): Sure you want to speak that a bit, David?\n\nDavid Gogel (18:58): Yeah I mean I think one of the most interesting aspects of governance is really people are debating all kind of proposals out in the open and so if you go to our forums and and specifically look at the thread that Jerry's mentioning, there's a lot of discussion around different ways to tweak the various formulas for either the trading rewards on one side or the LP rewards on the other. I think if you look specifically at the trading rewards thread there was one or two comments for people kind of promoting the idea that reward should be paid in USDC instead of the dYdX native token. I don't remember exactly how much traction that idea received but certainly I think like any idea proposed on the forums there's great ideas and then there's also just ideas that require further analysis. I think overall it's important to remember that these formulas are not static and the community really has the power to change the formulas as they wish. I think to be able to do that, people have to not only share ideas but provide thorough analysis and try to build consensus to get a snapshot vote passed, and then for certain decisions, an on-chain vote. So I think if you look at the quality and depth of research that Max Holloway put together for the trading rewards formula change which was really just limited in scope to increasing the weight parameter and then decreasing the open interest weight parameter, that was backed by a very extensive research proposal with all of the trade-offs and considerations for discussion and so ultimately that that's the proposal that passed. I think if we fast forward a year or five years from now, it's very likely that these formulas will continue to evolve as the best ideas surface to the top. The one Jerry that you mentioned I think has its merits but it's certainly something I encourage the community to continue to explore and debate and come up with a more concrete position on.\n\nJerry Sun (21:37): Got you, sweet! You guys also mentioned this second proposal and full disclosure to everyone here, I think this is a more recent proposal that was initiated in the forums but there was this kind of liquidity provider related proposal. I'm hoping is anyone able to kind of speak to that a little bit on the call? Maybe just share what it is and kind of why it was proposed?\n\nVijay Chetty (22:07): Yeah sure happy to do that. So this change relates to the liquidity provider rewards formula which as David was mentioning earlier is really targeted specifically at two-sided liquidity providers also known as market makers who provide liquidity in exchange. So obviously there's a lot of these types of players in crypto and they're some of the largest types of trading firms and capital markets firms in this space and so they can often serve this role where they stand as a willing buyer and seller for other users of the exchange and they also have proprietary arbitrage strategies that they run often in tandem with those market making strategies. And so this program is really geared towards that class of players and as David was mentioning in the initial formula design, we wanted to weigh the set of deterministic factors that really matters to successful exchange liquidity. Right and those can be quantified so there's the depth of how deep is the market, their spread of how tight is the market, uptime of how consistently is that liquidity available especially in periods of volatility and market drop-offs. And then there's a separate reward allocation for each market so the market maker is active in more markets and they stand to earn more rewards for running the same strategy. And this has proven to be quite successful in terms of encouraging like the initial liquidity of dYdX to the point that we've had more depth at tighter spreads than both FTX and Binance at most times in the market. So that's something that we found has been very effective in creating such an inviting environment for retail users to come in and trade and even large institutional firms who come in and trade seven or eight figures on a market buy or hedge or something like that. So it's really been valuable for us to take the exchange out to users and to non-US users and see a lot of value in it. Now that historically the payout of that rewards program, the LP rewards program has largely been concentrated to a handful of players who have really optimized their strategies for that rewards program. So as a result that's led to a lot of liquidity but especially deeper down in books a lot of that liquidity is often not getting crossed. So it's not essentially useful liquidity to the exchange environment. So that's issue one and issue two historically in recent months is that the rewards distribution itself has been fairly concentrated to these two or three players who really optimized for rewards. So for those two reasons, the community again rallied around this formula to basically research and analyze this series of changes. I think what was especially interesting about this latest snapshot proposal that's making its way to the forums as we speak is that it was the conclusion of collaboration among a number of key players in the ecosystem. So Max from Xenophon was heavily involved with this. Chaos Labs ran a comprehensive analysis and will continue to support the evolution of this formula and Wintermute who's a major market maker and one of the few that's actually been earning a bulk of the rewards, actually made the proposal and worked with those other two to kind of analyze it. And so we think it's really from our perspective as a team, which seems like quite a robust and well-developed conclusion that we also hypothesize has the potential to solve those aforementioned problems. So essentially really incentivize liquidity that's actually crossed and generating volume and then also to lead to support more equal rewards distribution among the players who are providing that utility to the exchange. And so in a nutshell the change is to basically add in a volume factor and overweight that volume factor in the formula such that players who are not only providing liquidity but doing it at the top of the book and therefore crossing a lot of volume will earn more rewards than somebody who just simply provides a lot of depth in the books. So we think this is a great step forward to basically incentivizing that more active useful liquidity and it'll also hopefully lead to more distribution among the many other market makers who have been ramping up strategies for this rewards program as well. And sort of in tandem with that change, the weighting distribution for the other factors, specifically depth and spread will go down and uptime continues to have an exponent of five just given how important that factor is for an exchange success. So this formula change for LP rewards is being captured in a snapshot as we speak and we're hopeful that it'll incentivize more market makers to come in and play on that side of things as well, along with just increasing the quality of liquidity on the exchange.  \n\nJerry Sun (27:07): Got it. One of the things I think that's pretty interesting about what you said is you think about these large market makers that are already existing on the platform and they get a tremendous number of these rewards that you guys are distributing and they're actually the ones going and suggesting this implementation right? Am I understanding that correctly?\n\nVijay Chetty (27:32): That's right. So not in all cases. So for example for the trading rewards proposal, that was suggested by Max and his team. For the LP rewards proposal, that was proposed by Wintermute but in tandem with Max as well as Chaos Lab. So there's often a lot of conversation that happens on the forums or between two parties who are active in the community and that'll sort of lead to proposals being made. So from our perspective we're very excited to see that because that's really the vision we've always had which is that the stakeholders in this ecosystem, meaning the market makers, the proprietary firms and the traders who are most active, they're the ones who are also active in governance and that's sort of the flywheel that we've always intended to create. Not just on the institutional side but the retail side. So it's really great to see these market makers who have these active roles and large holdings really take advantage of that and put their voice on the forum. And I think what particularly stands out in this case is you had a market maker essentially actively acting against their own interest. One of you is one of the two or three who stand to gain the most from the status quo yet a desire to kind of create an overall successful environment for all market participants led them to propose this change. And I think that's just really a testament to the power of governance and sort of shared decision making because you wouldn't tend to see behavior like that in other venues, especially centralized ones. So it's really encouraging from my perspective at least.  \n\nJerry Sun (29:06): Right that was the point I was going to make too. Just kind of clarifying that basically what you said is it sounds like Wintermute benefits a lot and the fact that they're going and being the ones to go and suggest this proposal in the first place is definitely very extraordinary and one of the aspects that's positive from community governance.\n\nDavid Gogel (29:27): Yeah I think the only thing I would add is like there's a difference between kind of short-term benefit versus long-term benefit. I think even Wintermute, Calan and his post, refers to long-term sustainable growth of the protocol and I think Wintermute recognizes that a too heavy concentration of rewards in the hands of only a few market makers probably results in a worse outcome over the long run. So I think it's great to see Wintermute among many others have this longer term view of how do we build over the three to five year time horizon, the largest crypto exchange. And at times that means putting your individual interests at a loss at kind of the expense of growth of the overall protocol and growth of the overall ecosystem as a whole.\n\nJerry Sun (29:06): Right, that makes a ton of sense. I think just adding on to that one of the things I'm always kind of astounded by with dYdX is its ability to really compete with centralized exchanges. I wrote about this in the report when I was looking at volumes how dYdX has comparable volumes to a lot of other centralized exchanges in the space and so I can understand I guess from Wintermute\u2019s perspective, it's kind of backing a decentralized player and hoping to continue to grow the ecosystem and seeing those long-term benefits pay out, not initially just kind of immediately taking all the rewards as they stand right now. Cool, great stuff. Ashu, I think we want to move a little to governance here. I think we're about halfway through the hour and I wanted to make sure that we have some time to kind of chat about some of these grant programs. Sorry, some of these grants that were funded, completed and kind of maybe what gets you guys excited about what's upcoming.\n\nAshu Pareek (31:32): Yeah so I'm just switching gears. I think the biggest sort of governance event over Q1 was the grants program, DIP-6. So if you just want to talk a little bit about that, what it is and then maybe tell us about some of the projects that have really impressed you, that really stand out so far and then what's ahead in the pipeline that you're really looking forward to or any of the RFPs, the request for proposals, that you're really eager to see filled, I think that would be great.  \n\nDavid Gogel (32:02): Awesome, yeah thanks for highlighting the dYdX grants program and DIP-6 which was definitely a major milestone I think for the community at large. I guess for those who aren't familiar, Reverie, which is a company kind of working on helping DAOs bootstrap from zero to one, is really kind of the mastermind behind the dYdX grants program. They ended up going through the governance process and getting, basically nearly unanimous support for about 750,000 dYdX to be used to fund the dYdX grants program. And so at the time, that was worth about $6 million or so to be used for grants and really represented one of the largest grants if not the largest grants program in all of DeFi. And so the grants program and kind of their mandate is really quite large. They've backed over 60 projects or so at this point and are active contributors that span everything from product development, marketing, education, international growth, and then kind of everything in between. And so overall I think it's been really great to see that project kick off and really deliver widespread funding to many active contributors in the ecosystem. I think just a few hours ago the dYdX grants program announced a wave 10, I believe, of funding and so that brings the total kind of dollar amount to, I want to say around $2.2 million or so allocated to 60 teams. And so really in just a few months the grants program has really been incredibly successful from my standpoint at bringing active contributors and long-term contributors to the ecosystem, many of which are building really important tools and research that drive kind of the protocol forward. I think the other kind of exciting development to maybe double click on a little before I share some of the grants that I'm personally excited about is really talking a little bit about the Guernsey purpose trust which was another DIP that was approved by the community and implemented by the dYdX grants program. Effectively this is pretty complicated but really innovative legal structuring that basically creates what's called a purpose trust structure in the Guernsey Islands and effectively converting the existing grants committee as well as the multisig into a legal wrapper which basically reduces the risk for all parties involved while increasing or while also kind of streamlining the operational on and off ramps with operating a DAO. And so there's a lot of benefits that kind of come along with the trust structure. The dYdX foundation published an open-source, a lot of research related to this, and I encourage all those interested to take a look. But the TLDR is that it does increase kind of the flexibility for the grants committee as well as multisig holders to be able to effectively operate the grants program while minimizing their personal liability but still kind of remain or retain the key aspects of community control and the community mandate that was entrusted in them by the snapshot vote. So both the establishment of the dYdX grants program and then the establishment of the Guernsey Trust, are both major milestones for the protocol and together have in my opinion resulted in a very successful grants program overall. So that's kind of the structure at a high level. The one thing, the last thing I'll add is again when grants requested funding, the dYdX token price was about double that at which it is today. I think the grants program in just a few months has already deployed close to two-thirds if not slightly more than that to fund all existing projects, and many of which are either paid in dYdX tokens, US-based applicants are paid in USDC. But I think we're definitely nearing kind of the last innings of dYdX grants version one and excited to see all of the lessons learned that the Reverie team has collected and, I know that they're starting to think through what does the next version of the grants program look like and how to scale that with future plans so that's kind of what happens behind the scenes with the grants program. But overall I think the Reverie team has done a great job and they're really the people and team kind of independently spearheading that overall project.  \n\nJerry Sun (38:13): So what is the Reverie team's specific involvement? Like are they looking at applications, are they just kind of managing the inbound applications that come in or how does the foundation and Reverie kind of work together? Or what's the overall level of involvement from their end?\n\nDavid Gogel (38:34): Yeah, so really the Reverie team is really the single party that manages dYdX grants. dYdX foundation, isn't involved. We help them kind of navigate the governance process but ultimately they're the ones who put together the proposal, submitted the snapshot and then once they receive the funds from the community treasury, have been working to operationalize that. And so I think my understanding of kind of their role is they, set up the dYdX grants website, they helped draft a lot of requests for proposals, they review applications and then they provide recommendations to the multisig, the owners of the multisig who were approved by the community to approve grants on almost a weekly basis. And so there's just a ton of operational work both on the reviewing of the application, setting up the trust structure and then coordinating payments to 60 plus teams, is a massive undertaking that I think the Reverie team has done a pretty phenomenal job at over the last few months. Here and then the grants program as well as various applicants do reach out to the dYdX foundation team and we do provide feedback, where appropriate but really the decision for funding is entirely led by the Reverie team and the multisig team and we really have no impact or decision making ability there whatsoever.  \n\nJerry Sun (40:19): Do they provide updates for completed grants or things like that?  \n\nDavid Gogel (40:25): Yeah definitely. So they have the dYdX grants website which has a lot of information both in terms of the open RFPs which that list is updated relatively frequently as well as all funded grant applicants as well as all completed projects. And so the way that they've structured most of these projects is at 25% of proceeds up front and then 75% upon completion. We've already seen probably I want to say seven or eight projects that have been completed and those have been shared on social channels on twitter and then on the website and then a lot of teams are still working on kind of their various projects and once completed will be updated on the website. I do know the grants program did fund an RFP for someone to redesign the grants website and so I think a big part of their mandate is also to showcase all of the completed grants and make sure that all the users of the community have access to those and know what has been done and provide kind of transparency around funding and completion of grants more broadly. But that is overall an ongoing process.\n\nAshu Pareek (41:57): Got you.  \n\nDavid Gogel (42:00): Yeah, I think just maybe to follow up on the second part of the question which is, \u201cAre there specific grants that have been completed that I'm personally excited about.\u201d I would say overall I've been just really impressed by the number of applicants to the grants program. There's been over 60 that have been funded but probably several hundred applicants that have applied overall. I think some recent ones that get me really excited, there was the dYdX info Twitter account which launched maybe two or three weeks now and that's just a twitter bot that leverages API like the dYdX API and on-chain data and posts relatively frequently high-volume trades like stats around market volatility, new market listings and then other insights going on the protocol and sharing that programmatically on Twitter. I think that's really awesome to keep everyone abreast of the large trades that are going on dYdX and really creating that social loop for the community on Twitter. So that's one example that I was excited about. I think I've been really impressed by all of the research that Max Holloway and Chaos Labs have done and both of those individuals and groups were individually sourced via the dYdX grants program. And I think for anyone who has read their research and simulation analysis, I think that probably one of the best outcomes for the dYdX grants program is really to identify high value contributors and try to get them to help us think through and help the community think through these really complicated projects and then ultimately become, long-term service providers or contractors or employees for the DAO at large. And so I've been very encouraged to kind of see the quality of the research that continues to come out there. The other two that I'm really excited about that haven't been completed yet but have been funded, the first is a project called RabbitHole. And so the grants program funded a RabbitHole quest to basically provide funding for community members who complete certain steps and get activated on the dYdX protocol. So RabbitHole has funded a number of other quests but I would expect some form of request to be launched for dYdX where basically smaller holders can deposit funds on dYdX, do various actions and then get dYdX as a form of a reward for using the product. And I think that's really great from an education standpoint so yeah that's one that I'm particularly excited to see and then the last one is, maybe a fun one, a company or a product called Gather Town. Gather Town is kind of a Web3, online gaming space where basically community members can join. They can interact with each other in new ways through a mix of kind of a gaming interface and then video chat and we think from a community building hosting event standpoint, that's really a way for you to know community members who are spread out all around the world and can kind of interact in a more internet native way. But that's fun and different and so a team is currently designing a dYdX branded Gather Town space and we're excited to host community events and community AMAs in that format in the future. So yeah I think those are just some examples on my side. But overall really excited to see all the initiatives and projects that are getting shipped and worked on.\n\nAshu Pareek (46:35): Awesome! Thanks for going through all of that. And so now we kind of have like 15 minutes left. So just for the last 15 minutes, if you want to talk a little bit about what you've kind of alluded to earlier regarding dYdX V4. I think that was the really big announcement at the beginning of Q1, so if you can just tell us a little bit about that and then maybe any updates you might have since the initial announcement.  \n\nCorey Miller (47:08): Sure yeah, happy to talk a little bit about that. So yeah, so dYdX V4 is something that a lot of the team is currently working on. The goal here is to make dYdX V4 100% decentralized. And so what that really means is at the moment dYdX is kind of a hybrid decentralized exchange, so parts of the stack are still operated by dYdX trading, that being the order book and the matching engine. And so the goal here with V4 is to make that 100% decentralized, along with everything else in the tech stack and obviously that's a really hard technical challenge. The product experience that has made dYdX so popular and that our traders have come to expect is partly because we are somewhat centralized still and so when you want the performance that we have, it is quite challenging to do that in a way that of course is 100% decentralized. So with that being said it's a large technical undertaking and it's something that we've been working on for a little while now and something that we will continue to work on for the next six months or so. We are making quite a bit of progress on what we think will be a really fantastic product. Having said that, there's not too much to share quite yet. We are on track, I would say, to launch something by the end of the year here. But other than that, we're not really in a spot quite yet to share what the details will be. But it will be quite different than what it looks like today. We have been kind of going deep on a variety of, call it scaling methods here. Other Layer-twos and other Layer-ones, potentially creating our own layer one like all of these things are kind of on the table here and stuff that we are going deep on. But yeah having said that, there's not too much to share quite yet but I do think the product experience will be really good and it'll be something that all of our traders will be excited about and I think the token community at large will be extremely excited about it as well.  \n\nAshu Pareek (49:40): Okay yeah great. I mean okay you said that you probably can't share too much, so I won't try to press too hard. Is there some way that the team is thinking about sort of on-chain scalability for the matching engine and the order book. Those have been kind of intractable problems so far so is there anything you can kind of expand on there?  \n\nCorey Miller (50:05): Yeah, I mean as everyone knows right, if you try to build something that's fully on-chain on something like Ethereum, you run into a lot of challenges which is why we were one of the first products to ever go onto a Layer-two, which is Starkware. I think we really proved that method could scale and at the end of the day, we made a really good product here. But as we look for the next stage of the protocol, although the current product is great, it doesn't really satisfy all the requirements that we have to really become fully decentralized and give all the control to the token holders. So with that we do believe there are ways to do on-chain order books in such a way that is exciting. Yeah, so again it's not something that we're ready to share quite yet but we are pretty optimistic that we will be able to get to a point that people are really excited to trade on the exchange, both for the users that are already on dYdX today, but also in the future. So making it easy and simple to kind of onboard the exchange in the future and in perpetuity and then also giving control to the community of token holders to kind of adjust the protocol as they see fit.  \n\nAshu Pareek (51:29): Okay, yeah and then one other thing that really intrigued me in the announcement post was around this idea of permissionless market creation. I think that's sort of a huge sort of attraction for DeFi. That's a big promise of DeFi. So what or how do you think that's going to look in dYdX V4 or how is the team thinking about sort of creating the rails for that?  \n\nCorey Miller (51:57): Yeah, so maybe I could talk a little bit about how it works today and we can talk about what it might look like in the future. So today market creation is kind of like a two-step process. Number one, the asset has to be listed on the actual smart contracts so any new assets would have to go essentially to a token holder vote to theoretically add them to the dYdX smart contract. Right now, prior to the token launch, the dYdX team did kind of like include a set of tokens that did not need any sort of governance launch to launch on the exchange. And so that's kind of the basket of tokens that we've been working on to date. Every week we're kind of listing like one or two markets but for instance if any hot tokens were released since then and today call it like Apecoin or something like that, those are not on the smart contract so we would need the community to do a governance vote to add those. David could probably talk a little bit more about this but there are kind of some people here who are working on setting up a standard to add new tokens to the smart contracts. Now, I mentioned it's a two-step process so once they are on the smart contracts, it doesn't necessarily mean they would be added to the exchange. So as I mentioned before dYdX does have some centralized components and therefore we must abide by any regulations that we might be in all jurisdictions that we're in right. And so having said that we don't allow any equities to be added to the smart contract or to be added to the exchange rather. And so essentially what this means is anything that is added to the smart contract still has to go through some sort of legal review to be added to the product. In the future version of the product, yeah it'll likely be set up in a way that is permissionless. dYdX the trading entity itself, we will not have any affiliation with adding new markets. So that'll strictly be in the hands of token holders. It's possible like, it's kind of speculation right now about how this will work because I'd say we're still working on it but yeah depending on like who's operating the front end or something like that maybe you'll have access to some markets and not others but generally, the protocol will be set up in a way where we're removed from that process entirely and we cannot control what goes on the dYdX protocol in terms of assets. So it'll be the community to kind of come up with what they want to add, what risk parameters they want to have and perhaps any other methodologies they would want to add to the governance.  \n\nAshu Pareek (54:55): Okay, yeah super interesting! Great. And then I think one question that I had and somebody had asked earlier in the chat was about distributing trading fees. So just how is the team or the community started thinking about how trading fees would be distributed in this model?  \n\nCorey Miller (55:13): Yeah it's a great question and something that again will be entirely up to the token holders. The one thing that we have said publicly is that dYdX trading will not take any trading fees and so what happens to those trading fees if anything is kind of up in the air still. I imagine that will be something that is a hot topic in the future for the community itself but again none of us on this call will have any influence there or any say in exactly what happens. It'll be quite an exciting time in my opinion, at least for the token holders to kind of come together and figure out a way forward.  \n\nAshu Pareek (55:58): Yeah definitely, so I think that's it for my end. Jerry, I don't know if you have. You're on mute.  \n\nJerry Sun (56:11): Sorry about that. I guess just to kind of tie things around at the very beginning, we kind of talked about the different entities within dYdX and we're on this topic of V4. Really, like how do you think that will change once V4 is implemented? Kind of like what is going to be the role of dYdX trading at that point. And I assumed like the foundation will still be around, kind of with its role within the community but I\u2019m hoping you guys can kind of speak that a little bit.  \n\nCorey Miller (56:39): Yeah, so I guess on the trading side of things we'll still be very much involved in moving the protocol forward. As it relates to runway and things like that we've set up dYdX trading in such a way where we have enough runway for four or five plus years right now and so we very much intend to be fully involved with the protocol even after V4 is launched. Over the very long term, I think the foundation and the DAO will kind of be more involved with determining what the DAO wants to spend money on in terms of development and things like that. But that's kind of a little bit more down the line I would say. And the very near to midterm, dYdX trading will certainly be fully involved in aspects of the protocol that we feel we can have an impact on while still remaining not 100% involved in every single thing that happens. Right, so making sure that like we're doing things that the token holders are interested in us, doing things that we think will move the protocol forward but at the end of the day, not being in actual control of the actual smart contracts and the protocol entirely.\n\nDavid Gogel (58:00): Yeah and from the foundation standpoint our objective is really to foster community-led growth development and self-sustainability of the overall DAO and community. We're a non-profit, we don't have a revenue model so at some point we will likely or definitively run out of funding and so for us like really our objective is really to accelerate the maturity of the dYdX DAO. And so by the time V4 is launched, we have the best in class DAO and best community possible to really be able to govern that successfully. So I think we've always expected to have a more limited kind of runway, we'll still be certainly around for a few years and we're definitely scaling the size of our team globally but I think there's a world where at some point we envision a lot of the resources and team members and partners that we're developing relationships with today, at some point we have all, we envision that, all of that will kind of fold into the dYdX DAO at large in a way that is kind of a step forward where it is really token and community member controlled from start to end.  \n\nJerry Sun (59:39): Got you. Last couple of questions here just for the community, make sure we kind of just like to get to them here, \u201cOne of them is when is dYdX mobile app out of beta and do you guys have a timeline for that?\u201d\n\nCorey Miller (59:55): So the mobile app will be out of beta within basically the next week and a half or so. Yeah, it's a really exciting update. The beta itself has been going really well. We had over 200,000 people sign up for the waiting list here. We added roughly like 10,000 people which is the max we can add. Yeah like Apple's regulations there but yeah likely sometime next week, the mobile app will be kind of ready to go and yeah people will be able to fully experience this like the product that we've been heads down working on for a while.  \n\nJerry Sun (1:00:34): Got you. Make sure we got everything here. One last question from Seth here, \u201cIt looks like when you put maker volume in LP reward, I think something like wrongful volume, are you wash trading? Might impact the reward? How will you plan to deal with it?\u201d\n\nCorey Miller (1:00:55): Yeah so wash trading is something that is arguably incentivized in some ways via these like various liquidity mining programs. Basically the way we have already and will in the future combat this is doing technical reviews and manual reviews of all the trades that happen on the platform and so basically throughout the epoch and specifically at the end of the epoch, we check for any suspicious activity that's ongoing and any traders that are identified as doing wash trading or any other source of the various activities, we disinclude them in the ability to have any like trading rewards from the epoch. And so yeah that is something that we actively monitor both internally and we use external providers as well to combat and so yeah we've done a good job of doing it today and I think if we do it like, if we make this upgrade in the liquidity provider rewards, a similar thing will happen as well where we will kind of just monitor it and punish anyone who basically violates those terms.\n\nJerry Sun (1:02:08): Awesome! Well I think we are a little past the hour here. I think we can kind of wrap it up here but appreciate you guys all for calling in, kind of answering some of these questions and taking these questions from the community as well. Yeah, thanks for joining here.  \n\nCorey Miller (1:02:27): Yeah, thanks for having us.\n\nDavid Gogel (1:02:29): Yeah thank you guys\n\n  \nJerry Sun (1:02:31): All right thank you guys, thanks everyone!", "references": [{"name": "Jerry Sun", "url": ""}, {"name": "Ashu Pareek", "url": ""}], "published_at": "2022-05-04T16:49:00Z", "author": {"name": "Jerry Sun, Ashu Pareek"}, "tags": ["Quarterly-Reports"], "url": "https://messari.io/article/state-of-dydx-q1-2022-analyst-call-transcript"}, {"id": "13c048fa-5e7b-4f54-a803-bc7282723ef4", "title": "Orca: Solana's Human-Friendly Automated Market Maker", "content": "Key Insights\n\nOrca is a Solana-based automated market maker (AMM) decentralized exchange (DEX).\nOrca has a core focus on user interface, bolstering ease of use and accessibility through human-centered design.\nAs the largest pure AMM on Solana, Orca places special emphasis on the composability and simplicity of the AMM and is set up to be a \u201cDeFi lego\u201d (middleware) for the ecosystem.\nOrca recently launched Whirlpools, concentrated liquidity pools akin to those on Uniswap V3, to bolster capital efficiency for liquidity providers and improve execution for traders.\nWith the recent launch of Governance v0 and plans to enable community Whirlpool listings, Orca is working towards decentralizing decision making.\n\nTo humans, orcas are friendly, accessible, ambassadors for the ocean, but in the marine ecosystem, they are apex predators.

The most popular type of DEX is the AMM, which relies on mathematical formulas rather than order books to price assets.\n\nWithin this large market, Orca differentiates itself by focusing on human-centered design and simplicity. The AMM implements unique features that simplify and improve trading and liquidity provision. Orca also stands out as the first major Solana AMM to roll out concentrated liquidity, improving on the capital efficiency and trade execution of the standard constant product market maker (CPMM). Finally, Orca offers a software development kit (SDK) to further grow its volume and liquidity. Projects across Solana can integrate with the exchange using the SDK. Looking forward, an easy-to-use SDK gives Orca the opportunity to become the Solana ecosystem\u2019s AMM middleware of choice.\n\nBackground\n\nFounders Grace Kwan and Yutaro Mori\u2019s extensive technical backgrounds and complementary skill sets led them to develop retail-friendly dApps.\n\nDuring the summer of 2020, the duo started working on a beginner-friendly interface for Aave\u2019s Ethereum-based lending market, but were quickly discouraged by high gas fees. To make their protocol accessible and profitable for smaller retail users, they needed lower fees. As a result, the team was drawn to the then-embryonic Solana network. By the end of the summer, they secured one of the earliest Solana Foundation grants to build the ecosystem\u2019s first pure AMM-based DEX.\n\nDown the Blowhole\n\nSwaps\n\nOrca\u2019s primary function is to facilitate spot swaps (trades) between certain supported pairs. Currently, the Orca team decides which pairs are listed.\n\nAfter plugging in a supported wallet, users can see their holdings in Orca\u2019s novel token balance panel. So, while the DEX is non-custodial, this feature allows users to see live balances without having to open browser extensions.\n\nToken balance panel. Source: Orca.so, YouTube\n\nAnother unique feature on Orca is the Fair Price Indicator. As users are making their trades, the Fair Price Indicator lets them know:\n\n1) The token price is within 1% of the CoinGecko price.\n\n2) The price impact, the effect of the trade on the market price, is less than 1%.\n\nIf either criterion isn\u2019t met, Orca will display a \u201cRate Warning\u201d for the first condition and a \u201cPrice Impact Warning\u201d for the second. Although users can still make their trade, they can use this feature to make their decisions with more certainty and without any extra steps (i.e., checking price trackers or exchanges).\n\nOnce a trade goes through, the balances are updated in the token balance panel, and a fee is deducted.\n\nFees\n\nThe Solana transaction fee is a fraction of a cent (<$0.01), charged in SOL. Orca charges 0.3% of the trade value, per constant product liquidity pool involved, as a fee. For Whirlpools the protocol charges 0.26% of the trade value, per Whirlpool involved, as a fee.\n\nFor each of these 0.3% swap fees, 0.25% goes to liquidity providers (LPs), 0.04% goes to the Orca Treasury, and 0.01% goes to the Orca Impact Fund. Whirlpools, however, currently don\u2019t take fees for the Orca Treasury (0.04%).\n\nFor stablecoins, the trading fees are 0.07% of the trade value, with 0.06% for LPs, 0.008% for the Orca Treasury and 0.002% for the Orca Impact Fund.\n\nThe Orca Impact Fund periodically donates the accumulated fees to nonprofits working on ocean conservancy and climate change.\n\nLiquidity\n\nEach Orca liquidity pool is a smart contract that holds reserves of both tokens in a trading pair (e.g., SOL/USDC).\n\nEvery two weeks Orca announces its Aquafarm Rotations. In Aquafarm Rotations, LPs can earn extra ORCA rewards in certain pools. ORCA emissions are set by the Orca team to incentivize liquidity to pools with high trading volume-to-liquidity ratios. Some pairs also have \u201cDouble-Dip\u201d pools, where users can stake their LP tokens to earn both ORCA and partner project tokens.\n\nOrca is currently rolling out Whirlpools as a second model for providing liquidity. Whirlpools is a concentrated liquidity model, available for select pools, and allows LPs to make markets within any price range. Since they aren\u2019t required to distribute liquidity across the whole price range (from zero to infinity), this method enhances their capital efficiency and fee earning potential.\n\nWhile Whirlpools do require LPs to manually place liquidity, Orca makes it easier by suggesting preset price ranges with different risk-reward profiles. After depositing liquidity, LPs will receive a Whirlpool NFT to represent the position.\n\nPricing Curves\n\nMost token pools on Orca still determine pricing algorithmically through a constant product market maker (CPMM). For stablecoins, Orca uses the StableSwap invariant, originally from Curve.fi.\n\nAt the moment, some swaps are routed through Whirlpools. Aggregating the different LP positions into a single pool creates a unique, combined curve to trade against. And since this liquidity concentrates around market prices (to earn higher fees), there\u2019s less slippage for traders.\n\nUser Interface Design\n\nOne aspect that seems to really stand out for users is the aesthetic appeal of the design. This includes the typography, with large, well-spaced, comfortable to read, numbers and letters, unique, well-drawn graphics and a cool color palette.\n\nOrca user interface. Source: Orca.so\n\nMost projects either disregard frontend design or tack on generic cyberpunk templates. Orca bucks the trend and drives community engagement through its user-friendly appearance and light, playful tone.\n\nOrcanauts\n\nIn late November 2021, Orca launched Orcanauts, a collection of 10,000 whale NFTs. Orcanaut holders are part of the Orcanautical Community and get exclusive access to products (e.g., Whirlpools during closed beta), communication channels, AMAs with the Orca team, and partnerships with NFT brands.\n\nOut of the $1.2 million raised as part of the mint, 75% went to NGO Aflatoun International to develop a crypto and DeFi education curriculum for youth, and the other 25% went to the artists.\n\nComposability\n\nOne of the core benefits of AMMs is their composability. In order to become a \u201cDeFi lego,\u201d Orca offers an open-source TypeScript SDK with all the same features as its application. Consistent with the Orca brand, the APIs are meant to be simple and easy to use, allowing developers to integrate, plug into, or build on the exchange\u2019s features (i.e., swaps, liquidity provision, price quotes, etc.). Orca also recently updated its SDK to include Whirlpools.\n\nSome examples of current integrations include swap aggregator Jupiter, portfolio visualization platform Sonar Watch, and yield aggregator Tulip.\n\nORCA Token\n\nORCA is Orca\u2019s Solana-based SPL governance token.\n\nOrca\u2019s token launched in August 2021, almost six months after the protocol went live. The initial supply of ORCA, 5.25% of the total supply, was retroactively airdropped to early traders and liquidity providers. 20% of the total supply was allocated to the team, with a 3-year vesting schedule and 1-year cliff. Since the airdrop, ORCA has been used primarily for liquidity incentives (e.g., Aquafarms) and fundraising.\n\nA little over one month after launching the token (September 2021), Orca announced an $18 million Series A led by Three Arrows Capital, Polychain Capital, and Placeholder. Other investors included Jump Capital, Sino Global Capital, Solana Capital, Coinbase Ventures, and DeFiance Capital. These investors received 9.6% of total ORCA supply with a 3-year vesting schedule and 1-year cliff.\n\nThe 4.3% for \u201cValue-add + Advisory\u201d is allotted to developers building on top of Orca through the Builders program and subject area experts contributing to the growth of the protocol (e.g., e^{i} Ventures and Reverie).\n\nIn April 2022, Orca expanded ORCA\u2019s functionality by launching the first iteration of its governance (v0). Up until April, there was only one governance vote. With v0, however, there is now a formal process around community governance. After discussion on the Orca Governance Forum, anyone with 100,000 ORCA can formally submit an on-chain proposal for changes to the protocol. Over a 7-day period, all (unlocked) tokenholders can cast one vote per ORCA. Proposals pass when they have over 500,000 \u201cyes\u201d votes, and are implemented by the Orca team.\n\nTraction\n\nAfter launching in February 2021, Orca took about six months to gain some traction. Since then, swap volume seems to be running in tandem with the price of Solana (SOL). Over the last six months, the average daily swap volume has been over $50 million.\n\nUntil recently, daily active users (DAU), measured by unique addresses, moved with swap volume. Starting in mid-March, however, DAU went from hovering around 5,000 to ranging between 20,000 and 30,000. Much of this decoupling seems attributable to STEPN, a lifestyle/exercise dApp that has recently gained traction among retail users.\n\nIn terms of all-time volume, however, the top two traded pairs are SOL-USDC and SOL-USDT, respectively. Two Ethereum pairs (ETH-USDC and ETH-SOL), a staked Solana pair (mSOL-SOL), and StableSwap routed USDC-USDT are also in the top 10.\n\nSeas Ahead\n\nMigration to Whirlpools\n\nThe most notable roadmap item for Orca is the shift to Whirlpools. At first, as concentrated liquidity pools are added, they will run in parallel with the pre-existing constant product liquidity pools. However, constant product pool rewards (Aquafarms and Double-Dips) will gradually turn off and be moved to Whirlpools. Additionally, Whirlpools not taking fees for the treasury will simultaneously increase yields for LPs and lower fees for traders.\n\nOrca also hopes to set up a framework for custom, community Whirlpool listings and launch fee tiers to allow LPs to mitigate volatility/manage margins.\n\nGovernance\n\nOrca plans to experiment and customize further in future versions of governance. This includes creating a new, custom governance platform since v0 is a deployment of Realms, Solana\u2019s open-source governance UI. The team also plans on experimenting with parameters such as discussion periods and vote thresholds. Additionally, future iterations may allow proposals to include code that automatically executes with governance approval.\n\nSolana\u2019s DeFi Lego\n\nThe Orca team will continue to announce new partnerships as it tries to become the base AMM infrastructure, or middleware, for Solana.\n\nThe Food Chain\n\nOrca has two main sets of competitors: pure AMM-based DEXs (such as Uniswap, Curve Finance, and Trader Joe) and Solana-based DEXs (such as Raydium and Serum).\n\nPure AMMs\n\nAs far as pure AMMs go, Orca doesn\u2019t have much competition on Solana. Its cross-chain competition, however, is fierce. Most of the cross-chain competition boils down to network-native liquidity. Some AMMs are dominant on single chains, such as Uniswap on Ethereum, SpookySwap on Fantom, and Trader Joe on Avalanche. Other AMMs are present on multiple chains, such as Curve Finance and SushiSwap.\n\nThe chain(s) a project chooses is critical because that determines its total addressable market (TAM). While it\u2019s hard to nail down a given chain\u2019s liquid value, one proxy metric is total value locked (TVL).\n\nSolana ranked third in TVL for much of the latter half of 2021 and has since dropped to fifth. If Orca wants to catch up to leading protocols such as Uniswap and Curve Finance, it needs to go cross-chain, or it needs Solana to attract more tradable volume on-chain.\n\nHowever, one major advantage for Orca, especially with its new concentrated liquidity pools, are the Solana network\u2019s low fees and fast transaction times. This allows users to quickly and cheaply trade and place/readjust liquidity.\n\nOn Solana, Orca\u2019s two main competitors are Serum and Raydium. Even though they are both DEXs, they differ from Orca in meaningful ways.\n\nSerum and Raydium\n\nSerum is Solana\u2019s largest DEX by trading volume. It uses a fully on-chain central limit order book (CLOB), and doesn\u2019t have its own frontend. In this sense, Serum isn\u2019t really an exchange at all. Instead, it functions more as an open-source order book middleware, allowing protocols to plug into its liquidity network.\n\nRaydium is the largest AMM on Solana at the moment. It plugs into and provides liquidity to Serum\u2019s open-source CLOB. As a result, Raydium LPs and traders get access to Serum\u2019s cross-protocol order flow and liquidity. The other key differences between Orca and Raydium are their features: Orca is starting to offer concentrated liquidity pools, while Raydium offers two Initial DEX Offering (IDO) platforms and permissionless pool creation.\n\nRaydium\u2019s model seems to offer two ends of the spectrum to LPs. They can either be passive across the whole price curve or actively manage an order book on Serum. Orca\u2019s concentrated liquidity pools offer some of the benefits of both aforementioned models while mitigating some of their drawbacks. Concentrated liquidity gives LPs better capital efficiency and the flexibility to select price ranges based on their willingness to actively manage and risk capital, which results in less potential impermanent loss. For traders, this model reduces slippage over the standard AMM (CPMM). By not integrating Serum, Orca can maintain its sovereignty at the protocol level, in addition to keeping its platform simple.\n\nClosing Thoughts\n\nFrom both an ethical and market perspective, two of DeFi\u2019s primary objectives are to democratize access and improve the financial experience. Orca lives up to this credo through human-centered design, customizable liquidity provision, and an easy-to-use SDK.\n\nThis report was commissioned by Orca, a member of Protocol Services.

The protocol allows anyone to create a pool of assets with predefined weights in the pool. Balancer strives to be a platform for DAOs and other protocols to build tools that provide useful liquidity to their end users and products. The protocol is managed by the Balancer DAO community and currently supports Ethereum, Polygon, and Arbitrum. Since launching V2 in August of 2021, Balancer\u2019s product line has expanded to include:\n\nWeighted Pools: Fixed weight pools that allow liquidity providers to create a rebalancing index fund, decrease risk of impermanent loss, and take a directional view while providing liquidity.\nStable Pools: Use different weighting math (stable math with an amplification factor, which balances constant sum and constant product math) to achieve deeper liquidity for price-similar assets (stablecoins, wBTC/renBTC/sBTC, etc). Stable Pools have tighter spreads and deeper liquidity for larger trades, benefiting from the vault introduced in V2.\nMetaStable Pools: A solution between Weighted and Stable Pools, MetaStable Pools are for correlated not pegged assets like yield bearing tokens against their native token DAI and cDAI or ETH and stETH.\nLiquidity Bootstrapping Pools (LBPs): Use weighted math with time-dependent weights, which allows for smoother token distribution releases. The pool can start with less capital (80% token / 20% stablecoin instead of needing to fund 50% stablecoin). The goal is to alleviate buy/sell pressure over fixed periods.\nManaged Pools: A feature-rich option that allows for up to 50 tokens. Some of the features include: Pool Manager(s), Management Fees (optional), Liquidity Provider Allowlists, Up to 50 Tokens, Active Token Management, Add, Remove, Change token weights, Circuit Breakers to protect from malicious/compromised tokens.\nBoosted Pools: Allows for tight stablecoin trading while using idle assets to loan on a lending platform. These pools offer increased capital efficiency for the liquidity provider and similar liquidity for the trader.\nCustom Pools: Use Balancer\u2019s vault and pools infrastructure to create your own pricing equations.\n\n  \n\nMacro Overview\n\nBecause Balancer DAO\u2019s goal is to optimize and manage a building block for other protocols, the number of new pools can gauge the adoption of the tools created by Balancer. In the first quarter, the growth in new pools accelerated again, increasing by 16.9% QoQ, growing faster than most leading DEXs. This growth clearly points to the increased adoption of the product.\n\nGiven the market\u2019s downturn, volumes fell dramatically from the Q4 2021. A less price-sensitive measure of usage is the number of swaps executed. Although end users executed 15.2% fewer swaps in the first quarter of 2022 than they did last quarter, it\u2019s much less than the 31.1% reduction seen in the market-leading AMM Uniswap.\n\nBalancer Liquidity Providers (LPs) did experience an outsized drop in revenues of 68.3%, falling from $43.7 million in Q4 to $13.9 million in Q1. The drops in market prices and number of swaps were certainly the largest contributors. A change in mix from volumes in Weighted Pools and Liquidity Bootstrapping Pools (LBPs) to stables had a large impact on revenue too, given the former two are typically much higher fee products.\n\nOn January 4, Balancer began taking a 10% protocol fee from LPs for the DAO treasury. So for each $1 of fees paid by traders, Balancer receives $0.10 and the LP receives $0.90. Without this change, fees still would have been down by 61% quarter-over-quarter.\n\nThe protocol continued to grow on Polygon, unencumbered by the bear market conditions. A total of 563 new pools were launched on Polygon in the quarter, bringing the total number of pools that have launched on Balancer on the L2 network to 1,059. Weighted markets were the primary growth engine, adding 453 new markets to the existing 314. Liquidity and volumes saw higher growth in stable pools, likely because the volatility in stablecoin pegs allowed for more arbitrage opportunities as well as more users opting for safety.\n\nSimilar to usage on Polygon, usage on Arbitrum continued to improve in terms of swaps, volumes, and new pools. Liquidity was net reduced from Balancer pools on Arbitrum in the first quarter. Pool count accelerated its growth from the fourth quarter of last year.\u00a0\n\nMicro Overview\n\nAlmost all new activity on Balancer is now on V2, which was first launched in the second quarter of 2021. Isolating V2 on Polygon and Ethereum, adoption continued to grow at a rapid pace, with new markets growing by 89% in the quarter. Moreover, liquidity only dropped by 6% on V2 in the quarter despite the large drop in the markets. The divergence can largely be attributed to the increase of liquidity in Stable Pools on Balancer V2. Stable Pool liquidity doubled on Polygon, and it grew by 23% on Ethereum.\n\nBalancer\u2019s two highest volume pools in the quarter were both stable pools. The staBAL3 Stable Pool with DAI/USDC/USDT had the highest volume, with $1.4 billion in the quarter. Volume was dominated by whales (measured as users who have transacted over $1 million on Balancer).\n\nHigh-frequency traders (a user who has made 50 or more trades in any one pool in a day) remained around flat in the quarter in absolute number versus the previous quarter. However, their share of total volume increased from ~10% to ~17%.\n\nThe USDC/TUSD/DAI/USDT Stable Pool on Polygon was the second highest volume pool with over $1.1 billion in volume in the quarter. The growth in Polygon\u2019s largest stable pool was dramatic and widespread, with usage by over 350,000 unique users in the quarter and over $1 billion in volume. Less than a third of the volume was from high-frequency traders (measured as accounts that made more than 50 swaps in any pool in a day).\n\nMost Stable Pools face the problems of capital efficiency for stablecoin liquidity providers. The largest stablecoin pool on Balancer averaged 21.4% utilization rate (average daily volume/average daily liquidity) in Q4\u201920, leaving a large majority of the capital unproductive. One solution to the problem is taking the liquidity from the pool and lending it on Aave, Compound, or other liquid lending platforms until it is needed. But this process quickly becomes inefficient because of the gas fees.\n\nOn December 13, Balancer launched Boosted Pools to solve this problem. The protocol created Linear Pools, which are pools of assets paired with the interest-earning version of the same asset (for example, DAI-aDAI) that use a linear pricing curve to incentivize arbitrageurs to keep prices in line. Balancer then builds a pool of different stablecoin Linear Pools. These nested pools make up the Boosted Pool. As a result, Balancer can now offer a more gas-efficient, more capital-efficient stablecoin pool without impacting daily liquidity. Instead of wrapping and unwrapping tokens on demand, the onus is on arbitrageurs to keep the Linear Pools balanced. Meanwhile, liquidity providers in the stablecoin pools can earn extra yield on their capital. It also creates a more liquid market for yield-bearing token holders to exchange those assets.\n\nIn its first full quarter, the Aave Boosted Stable Pool of USDC/USDT/DAI grew to be 16% of Balancer\u2019s stable pool liquidity on Ethereum and 5.7% of its total liquidity. Though the Boosted Pool only did about a quarter of the volume of the regular DAI/USDC/USDT stable pool, the boosted pool almost surpassed it in liquidity (and did shortly after the quarter ended). Beneath the surface, trades on USDC and USDT were only by accounts totaling $10,000\u2013$50,000 in volume while DAI was entirely traded by users doing over $1 million in volume. The usage of DAI by larger traders is likely representative of arbitrageurs, given the liquidations and volatility of DAI in the first quarter.\n\nFocusing on V2, weighted pools continue to be the most utilized in terms of number of markets and number of swaps. V2 weighted pools more than doubled in the quarter. They also make up the vast majority of protocol revenues, collecting almost $2.4 million in the quarter, since Balancer turned on the 10% revenue-share on Ethereum on January 4. By volume, DAI/WETH 40/60 was the most active weighted pool on Balancer, churning over $840 million in volume in the quarter. It was followed by AAVE/WETH 80/20 (a V1 pool) and WBTC/WETH 50/50, with over $600 million each.\n\nThe largest Balancer pool by transactions on the Ethereum network is the DAI/WETH 40/60 pool. Volume, transactions, and users all increased in the quarter for this pool. It ranked third in total volume among all Balancer pools and was first among weighted pools by volume. This pool is also the second largest recipient of liquidity mining (LM) incentives from Balancer\u2019s LM program.\n\nIt was a much quieter quarter for Liquidity Bootstrapping Pools, likely due to the macro conditions and a less favorable environment to get liquidity. Volumes for LBPs were down 80%, and only 179 new LBPs were launched versus 243 last quarter. The three largest LBPs by volume were all launched using Copper, a platform to create an LBP using Balancer. The PDT launch saw $38 million in volume in 4 days, the SYNR launch did $30 million in 4 days, and the RSS3 launch did $25 million in volume.\n\nTreasury\n\nThe total treasury holdings for Balancer fell from $79.5 million in Q4 2021 to $67.2 million in Q1 2022, with a fairly flat 98% of it in the DAO Multisig wallet. In Q1, the token balance of BAL tokens in the DAO Multisig dropped 5%, while the USD value of BAL in the treasury fell ~16%. The DAO Multisig made a few new allocations as well including allocations to the Aave Boosted USD Pool and into the WBTC/WETH 50/50 pool. Excluding the yield-generating investments, the Multisig is 99% BAL tokens. Balancer has three other treasury wallets on Polygon, Arbitrum, and Fantom. The first two have roughly $400,000 and $250,000 respectively invested in Balancer pools. The Fantom treasury wallet has a 10 million BEETS allocation, which was allocated to the treasury as part of a friendly fork by Beethoven X to bring Balancer pools to Fantom.\n\nThe liquidity mining program was active in the first quarter, though it has since changed in favor of a new incentive mechanism. In the first quarter, Balancer used 1.37 million BAL as liquidity mining incentives. The BAL/WETH 80/20 pool remained the largest beneficiary of incentives, receiving 325,000 BAL tokens. The DAI/WETH 40/60 pair, staBAL3 (USDC/DAI/UST), and WBTC/WETH 50/50 pairs all received 192,000. The last notable earner was the boosted stable pool which received 180,000 BAL. In total, 34 pools received liquidity mining rewards.\n\nOn March 21, the DAO empowered the Treasury subDAO to invest protocol fees. At quarter end, about 13% of the mainnet DAO Multisig was invested in Rari pools, Balancer V2 pools, Lido, and others with the remaining 87% balance in BAL tokens. The subDAO can sweep tokens worth more than $10,000 into the DAO Treasury. At the end of March, the first sweeps brought $1.3 million to be invested mostly in the WBTC/WETH 50/50 pool and the boosted USD pool, as well as $1.2 million to be invested in the WBTC/WETH pool.\n\nBalancer\u2019s method of revenue collection creates a well-diversified income stream for the protocol, also allowing it to move away from reliance on BAL. In the first quarter, Balancer earned fees denominated in at least 57 different tokens, not even including LP tokens or pool tokens. The two largest token\u2019s by USD income in the quarter were wstETH and ETH, both over $500,000. wBTC was the next largest at more than $100,000. Note that 28.36 wstETH was returned to LPs from a bug in the protocol fee collector.\n\nMajor Q1 Announcements\n\nveBAL\n\nCertainly the biggest news of the quarter was the tokenomics change to veBAL. Before we discuss how veBAL changes incentives for the protocol, let\u2019s review how these tokenomics work.\n\nIntroduced by Fernando Martinelli on February 3, veBAL went live on Balancer on March 28th. veBAL brings vote escrow tokenomics to Balancer. veTokenomics offers tokenholders an incentive to lock-up their tokens for a fixed period of time. Based on how long a holder chooses to lock up their tokens, they receive tiered rewards like more weight in governance voting, boosted liquidity mining rewards, and voting power for reward boosts to certain pools. Under the new system, BAL will no longer be a governance token, and all votes will be done based on veBAL holdings.\n\nThe veBAL system takes vote escrow tokenomics and applies it to Balancer\u2019s mission. Unlike Curve where veCRV is received for locking CRV, veBAL is not obtained by locking BAL. BAL holders must provide liquidity to the BAL/WETH 80/20 pool to receive Balancer Pool Tokens (BPTs) for this pool. Those BPTs are what is locked for veBAL. The longest lock period is one year, and the longer the lockup, the greater the boost (using the same boosting equation as the Curve system). These long lock-up periods ensure that voting power goes to users with long-term visions for the protocol.\n\nThis is a complete reset of Balancer governance and tokenomics. By switching to veBAL as the governance token, BAL becomes a utility token whose value is derived from a supply-demand market. The supply side of the equation is now known and fixed given the new inflation supply schedule. The demand side will be determined by market forces weighing demand for future protocol revenues plus a governance premium. The demand side is slightly more complicated than that because in order to get veBAL users must provide a liquidity pair, so there is an aspect where demand will have to weigh the relative value of BAL and ETH.\n\nMost importantly, the new tokenomics attempts to better align incentives of veBAL holders and the protocol. In order to increase protocol revenues, one needs to drive more volume to the protocol (beta-adjusted). The incentive can enable veBAL holders to bootstrap new products and pools with short-term liquidity incentives. It can also direct incentives to pools where liquidity would otherwise not flow because of competing incentives or products.\n\nHowever, the new system still has some friction points. The largest likely being that it is unclear if the veBAL incentivizes holders to create new use cases on Balancer or simply to direct rewards to existing pools. A later snapshot vote does help with this directly, and perhaps paired together can create better incentives.\n\nThe new tokenomics can also crowd out new projects that now have higher entry costs to fund a new pool. For example, on top of the liquidity needed to fund a pool on Balancer, the builder might need to buy BAL/WETH to get veBAL to direct rewards and compete. That said, it may still be cheaper to get subsidized liquidity incentives from Balancer at the cost of funding the BAL/WETH pool versus funding your own liquidity incentives.\n\nUnder the current system, veBAL holders vote to allowlist new pools to get votes for boosted rewards. There is the risk of incumbency overtaking long-term benefit and voters not wanting new pools added to the list and therefore diluting their own incentives. But if veBAL holders can bootstrap new pools, they can increase revenues for the protocol as a whole and get a share of said revenues.\n\nThe team wisely alerted the community of two other risks in the governance proposal: immutability of the system impairs the ability to adapt in the future, and platforms built on top of Balancer can take control of the majority of votes and create central points of failure. Lastly, many holders were frustrated that veBAL can only be earned on Ethereum L1 mainnet, since many prefer to use Polygon and Arbitrum to avoid gas fees. L2 pools can still receive rewards, but only BPTs from Ethereum will be eligible to be locked for veBAL.\n\n  \n\nsubDAOs\n\nOn January 17, Balancer DAO voted to form subDAOs to improve governance as the protocol grows and evolves. Balancer DAO had already been operating with a Multisig and Grants DAO, but the new structure created Marketing, Ops, Partnerships, and Treasury subDAOs. Since the proposal passed and was implemented, the Treasury subDAO has been given approval to invest protocol fees (discussed above), and the Partnerships subDAO has provenance over liquidity mining rewards. The new structure should create focused teams executing defined purposes, all aligned under Balancer DAO. The teams have created a Notion page for the community to better track their efforts.\n\nOther Q1 Proposals and Updates\n\nMarch 24 - Grants DAO: Wave 3 Final Report\n\nThe Grants DAO continues to actively fund projects to improve Balancer DAO and benefit the community, approving 12 projects for over $300,000 in the first quarter.\n\nFebruary 16 - Increase the Protocol Fee\n\nThis proposal aims to increase the protocol fee activated at 10% to its maximum of 50%. The protocol fee is a percentage of trading fees earned by LPs. This proposition follows the introduction of a veBAL Tokenomics that incentivizes BAL emissions for locked LPs rather than revenue from trading fees. Hence, the goal is to drive the protocol's growth through BAL emissions and increase protocol revenue for BalancerDAO Treasury and the APR for aligned LPs in incentivized BAL pools.\n\nFeb 18 - Protocol Revenue Sharing for Pool Creators\n\nThis proposal aims to standardize protocol revenue sharing across all liquidity pool creators by implementing a FeeSplitter contract that interacts with the ProtocolFeesCollector so that a standard is enforced. This solution seeks to provide a frictionless revenue-sharing experience for developers building on top of Balancer as well as to minimize overhead for Balancer DAO by implementing an automated solution.\n\nThe initial proposed revenue share is ~10% with Balancer DAO maintaining authorization to boost the rate to a higher value for specific pools (i.e., 50%). The goal is to incentivize optimizing pools on Balancer.\n\nFebruary 27 - Governance Process Revamp 2.0\n\nThis proposal follows the Governance Process Revamp proposal. It aims to decentralize the BalancerDAO governance further and define valid proposals within the scope of veBAL holders and the duties of the Governing Council. These changes to the governance process can be summarized as follows:\n\nRemove the power of the Governing Council to determine whether a proposal has reached soft consensus to proceed to formal vote; instead, the Council assesses the progress of proposals based on whether the proposal is well-defined.\nSpecifies the constitutions of a \u201cwell-defined\u201d proposal to include a motivation, specifications with on-chain execution details when required, and applicable risks.\nEmpowers the DAO to replace the Governing Council if they fail to execute their duties in good faith.\nIt introduces a minimum quorum of 100,000 BAL and 51% majority for proposals.\n\nMarch 28 - Handover Swap Fee Control to Balancer DAO\n\nThis proposal aims to terminate BalancerDAO\u2019s contract with Gauntlet, which uses its Fee Optimization product to control Balancer protocol swap fees. The proposition seeks to handover the swap fee controller to the Treasury subDAO and eventually implement an open-sourced, fully automated dynamic fee control based on market conditions.\n\nMarch 21 - Delegate Treasury subDAO the Power to Invest Protocol Fees\n\nThis proposal aims to delegate the management of Balancer DAOs collected revenue from fees to the Treasury subDAO. Under the new veBAL tokenomics, 75% of protocol fees will be sent to veBAL, and 25% will go to Balancer DAO. The initial framework for the utilization of protocol fees includes: reduce selling pressure on BAL, ensure operational runway for the DAO, maximize risk-adjusted yield, and build protocol-owned liquidity. The Treasury subDAO will initiate a sweep of all collected protocol fees just before the launch of veBAL and invest them on behalf of the DAO.\n\nMarch 21 - Hexagon Friendly Fork\n\nThis proposal is drafted by the Partnership subDAO and aims to introduce a multifunctional platform, called Hexagon Finance. Hexagon will serve as a joint project between BalancerDAO, Ava Labs, and Terra Labs focused on bringing Balancer products and infrastructure (via a smart contract fork) to the Avalanche community. Balancer would be responsible for assisting in promotional activities such as public announcements, AMAs, the allowance of Hexagon Finance to use Balancer branding, and official approval of the Hexagon Finance protocol on Avalanche.\n\nHexagon Finance tokenomics would distribute 6%, or 6 million, of the total Hexagon Finance token supply to BalancerDAO. The release would be locked for 6 months upon launch and linearly vested for 12\u201324 months. Ava Labs will provide additional funds dedicated to the Liquidity Mining program, and Terra Labs will provide initial capital deployment of UST to build the initial phase of liquidity bootstrapping.\n\nConclusion\n\nDespite Q4\u2019s market drawdown, Balancer showed continued progress toward its goals in several key measures. By number of pools, Balancer continues to see DAOs and protocols use its platform to build. Although end users pulled back from the market, Balancer saw less of a downturn than some peers. The newly launched boosted stable pool continues to suck up liquidity, proving to be another useful tool on the platform.\n\nThe most important change in the quarter was the governance overhaul and announcement of veBAL. As a new incentive and voting mechanism, veBAL changes the dynamic for liquidity providers on Balancer and changes the utility of BAL. As the majority of DAO-directed liquidity mining rewards have started to wane, Balancer has turned to market forces to determine the allocation of its reward incentives going forward. The active community and strong team continue to work to improve the protocol and partnerships heading into the second quarter of 2022.\n\nAppendix\n\n  \nThis report was commissioned by Balancer, a member of Protocol Services.

While it\u2019s appealing to own a piece of a protocol via its tokens, sending tokens is often cumbersome and error-prone. Take, for instance, sending tokens to the wrong address or the constant juggling between user interfaces and wallets. \n\nFIO protocol is a viable solution to improve usability without compromising on decentralization \u2014 it offers a homogeneous user experience when transacting value across various blockchains and products. FIO uses human-readable wallet names to send, receive, and request digital assets.\n\nFIO offers three core functionalities to improve usability: (1) handles, (2) requests, and (3) data.\n\nFirst, FIO Crypto Handles are like email addresses for digital assets. Danielle@messari is a human-readable wallet name consisting of a username (Danielle) and a domain (@messari). Both usernames and domains are NFTs that substitute long public blockchain addresses. This reduces the risk of common mistakes such as sending tokens to the wrong address.\n\nSecond, FIO Requests are like https requests, but they are designed to preserve self-sovereignty. The request function allows users to request payments from other users, e-commerce order carts, or invoices. The prerequisite for this function is that both the sender and the receiver are utilizing FIO-enabled wallets. In terms of usability, FIO Requests are similar to using Paypal or Venmo.\n\nThird, FIO Data is metadata that can accompany any blockchain transaction using a FIO-enabled application. For instance, FIO Data enables requesting or sending invoice payments with cross-chain metadata that specifies what the invoice is for. The metadata is useful, for instance, when including an order cart or when referencing off-chain data. Other uses of metadata include full auditability and adding transaction details for legal and compliance requirements.\n\nBesides the three functionalities above, FIO offers an additional level of verifiability when protecting digital property. NFTs on any blockchain may be mapped to FIO Crypto Handles and FIO Domains. In this sense, FIO supports human-readable signatures as verification for digital property of NFTs created on any blockchain.\n\nTechnology in a Nutshell\n\nFIO is a standalone decentralized usability layer that can be integrated by any crypto product. The FIO Protocol is open and permissionless: be it wallets, exchanges, or payment processors, none of them require any permission to integrate with FIO.\n\nThe Guts of FIO Crypto Handles and Domains\n\nFIO Crypto Handles and Domains are nested NFTs: for instance, the natalie@pocket Crypto Handle has a different private key than the @pocket domain. Like an email domain, a FIO Domain may be public or private. For example, anyone can register a public gmail.com address because Google has made it open to do so. Similarly, a FIO Domain can be set to open status on the FIO blockchain by the private key holder, which would allow any FIO Protocol user to register a username on the @pocket FIO Domain (e.g., natalie@pocket). A closed FIO Domain would be similar to a domain like messari.io because only Messari can give permission for email addresses to be created with that domain. Private FIO Domain owners must sign a transaction on the FIO blockchain to approve the registration of a FIO Crypto Handle thereon.  \n\nAll of a user\u2019s wallet addresses can be mapped to a single Crypto Handle. Whether Natalie is transacting on Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche, etc., the FIO Crypto Handle natalie@pocket will do the job. Mapping involves signing a transaction on the FIO blockchain that links a public wallet key to a natalie@pocket Crypto Handle. This process is entirely non-custodial, as the FIO Protocol does not know the associated private keys. The mapping process is similar for addresses, NFTs, and even, in the future, fiat bank accounts.\n\nTransactions and Requests\n\nOnce a public key has been mapped to a Crypto Handle, any FIO-enabled transaction feels like sending an email. Users can ignore the underlying mechanisms and complex public addresses, because, from their point of view, they are just sending tokens from one party to another. Through this level of usability, the FIO Protocol enables users to transact on-chain within their favorite crypto product as easily as making a Venmo or PayPal transaction.\n\nFIO request functionality has an additional layer of logic that uses Diffie\u2013Hellman encryption to create a shared secret between a requester and requestee. The requester signs a transaction with encrypted metadata specifying the token amount, the Crypto Handle that will send the funds, and any associated data (e.g., a note, invoice, or order cart). The requestee\u2019s FIO-enabled product queries the FIO blockchain searching for requests. Following an in-app notification, the request is decrypted using their FIO private key. At this point, the user may choose to decline or accept the request. Should they accept an incoming transfer request, the transaction is made directly on the blockchain of choice from within the wallet. This transaction is entirely independent \u2014 as the FIO Protocol does not have access to user private keys.\n\nNetwork Usage and Economic Value\n\nFIO has seen a steady inflow of new Crypto Handle registrations ever since its launch in March 2020. More than two years later, on May 1, 2022, there were a total of over 704,000 FIO Crypto Handle registrations, out of which over 459,000 are presently active.\n\nThere has generally been an upward trend in the number of daily transactions leveraging the FIO Protocol, and several activity spikes following new integrations by wallets and exchanges.\n\nNext, let\u2019s assess FIO\u2019s potential market opportunity. In an ideal scenario, the FIO Protocol will be used as the standard usability layer for transacting digital assets. Unlike many Web2 applications that generate revenue solely from transaction fees, FIO uses annual charges on custom FIO Domains as well as prepaid bundles of transactions when registering FIO Crypto Handles. Below we depict a scenario for deriving the FIO economic value based on adoption assumptions.\n\nAccording to Metcalfe\u2019s law, the FIO network value can be considered to be proportional to the square of the number of active FIO Crypto Handles. The underlying assumption is that the number of transactions and their volumes will grow on par with the square of the number of active FIO Crypto Handles. Outside of Metcalfe\u2019s law, future enhancements to the FIO Protocol may open the door to more utility fees in return for additional user value.\n\nFIO Token and Its Tokenomics\n\nThe FIO community launched the FIO Protocol blockchain and token in April 2020. The FIO token is designed as an incentive for key network participants that integrate its features into their applications and as a reward for contributing to network consensus, staking, and governance.\n\nFIO Protocol Fees\n\nEach transaction within the FIO ecosystem has an associated fee in FIO tokens. To make for a smooth user experience, the majority of transaction types are covered upfront upon registering a FIO Crypto Handle. In return, users receive a set number of transactions per year that they can freely use without spending additional tokens. Additionally, the integrator (wallet or exchange) may select to cover the cost of registering Handles and their included bundled transactions on behalf of users. FIO has 21 active and 21 standby block producers (BPs). The 42 BPs set protocol fees and vote on protocol changes.\n\nGovernance\n\nAnyone may become a BP, but in order to produce blocks (as one of the 21 active validators) or set fees and earn rewards (as a standby validator), BPs must earn a top spot by voting power. Blocks are produced in rounds of 126. At the beginning of each round, 21 BPs are eligible to enter the active validator set, providing ample opportunity for BPs to become active should a new BP with significant ties to major stakeholders decide to contribute to network consensus. Ultimately, BPs are responsible for modifying system contracts and enacting protocol changes. A minimum of 15 BPs (i.e., greater than two thirds of the active validator set) must approve a proposal in order for it to pass.\n\nThe Foundation for Interwallet Operability (FIO) is allocated 5% of the protocol fees for running a DAO to coordinate protocol development activities with independent developers and contributors. The majority of entities participating in the DAO are wallets and exchanges that have joined the FIO consortium on a voluntary basis. In doing so, these entities participate in the governance process by signaling their support for the development of new protocol features, before being brought to a block producer vote.\n\nVoting Mechanism\n\nTo participate in FIO governance is to vote for network BPs. A FIO Crypto Handle is required, and tokenholders may either vote for block producers directly or delegate their voting power (number of tokens held in wallet) to active vote proxies. If a wallet or exchange wishes to participate as a network proxy, they act as the default governance proxy for the FIO tokens held in their users\u2019 wallets. Prominent FIO stakeholders can use this mechanism to contribute to network decision-making. \n\nFIO Improvement Proposals (FIPs) are publicly available for review on GitHub prior to BP vote. Feature proposals funded by the foundation require both review and consent to be prioritized on the roadmap. Considering that the protocol is open-source, self-funded FIPs may also be brought forth to BP vote at community member discretion.\n\nFIO Staking and Rewards\n\nFIO token staking went live in January 2022 and is available in partner wallets for users that have voted (or proxied) towards at least one BP. If a user stakes from a registered integrated wallet, the organization receives 11% of stakers\u2019 rewards. Staking rewards may be redeemed upon request while the original staked amount has a 7-day cool-down period.\n\nFIO\u2019s fee mechanism rewards stakers with 25% of the protocol fees, while BPs earn 60%. Aside from BPs and stakers, 5% is reserved for the foundation, and 10% is distributed to integration partners. If there aren\u2019t enough protocol fees to reward participants, FIO is drawn from reserves to subsidize BPs and stakers. A total of 20 million FIO (2% of the total token supply) is set aside in the BP reserve. If less than 50,000 FIO is collected in fees for BPs in a 24-hour period, tokens from the reserve will be supplemented to hit this cap until the reserve has been diminished. Similarly, 2.5% of the total token supply (25 million FIO) is set aside in the Staking Reward Reserve to ensure that staking rewards amount to 25,000 FIO per day amongst stakers, until this reserve is exhausted. Thanks to FIO\u2019s incentive mechanism and decentralized business model, the benefits are spread to all ecosystem participants.\n\nSource: FIO Protocol\n\nSupply Curve\n\nThe FIO token was launched independently of funding. A total of 50,000,000 FIO tokens were initially set aside and were subsequently allocated to the foundation. The token supply has a maximum of 1,000,000,000 FIO: 648,746,346 (65%) tokens were minted at Mainnet launch and 341,253,654 (34%) tokens are being minted over time. The foundation\u2019s allocation (9% of the total token supply) will be fully unlocked by December 2022. Although locked foundation tokens were not programmatically restricted from voting for BPs, the foundation has abstained from voting at the time of writing. The remaining tokens are set to be released linearly through 2033 as depicted below.\n\nFIO Ecosystem\n\nIntegration and Listing Agreements\n\nSince Q1 2020, 64 projects have joined or are in the process of joining the FIO ecosystem. Notably, 58 of these are FIO integrations into crypto products, while the remaining 13 are FIO listings for trading. The FIO rewards and incentive scheme is designed to encourage more projects to integrate FIO into their product offerings. The goal is for FIO-integrated products to have a substantial voice in governance, considering FIO is a usability protocol built for cryptoapplication providers.\n\nCrypto applications such as wallets, exchanges, staking platforms, and crypto payment processors that integrate with the FIO Protocol are entitled to a number of rewards over and above fee distributions and staking rewards. A pool of 125 million FIO (12.5% of the total token supply) is allocated for rewarding integrators. Integrators receive an additional 40% on top of fees for facilitating the registration of new Crypto Handles and Domains. These rewards will be distributed until this reserve is exhausted.\n\nThe foundation also subsidizes fees for registering Crypto Handles and Domains on behalf of an integrated product\u2019s users. Based on the number of users, the foundation awards wallets and exchanges with grants from $10,000\u2013500,000. FIO occasionally airdrops tokens for wallets with a large number of users. As a result, the number of integrations has grown steadily over the past 2 years, and 21 integrations are in the pipeline.\n\nPotential Development Roadmap\n\nCode development proposals are discussed, voted upon, and executed by the FIO community of developers. A summary of current and potential developments is graphically depicted below.\n\nThe current focus is on initiatives that simplify integration and help increase FIO adoption. On the wallet and exchange integration side, the top priority is the enhancements to the integration of software development kits. In terms of user experience and increased user adoption, a further simplification of the send feature is top of the list. In the long run, fiat account resolution and integrations appear to be important milestones toward large-scale adoption.\n\nFIO Competition and Main Challenges\n\nWhile the wallet naming space is relatively crowded, FIO\u2019s main value proposition stems from improved user experience and its ease of integration with other crypto products. When compared to established players such as Ethereum Name Service and Unstoppable Domains, FIO distinguishes itself by being more than just a wallet naming service. In addition to wallet naming, it offers payment request functionality, encrypted payment data, and NFT signatures. That being said, emerging players such as Request Network are starting to offer payment request functionalities. While Request Network is currently limited to Ethereum, Polygon, Celo, Fantom, and NEAR, it is expected to expand its list of supported blockchains. However, FIO clearly differentiates itself through its modular design: FIO was built to be interoperable with any blockchain.\n\nMoving forward, FIO needs to overcome several key challenges.\n\nFirst, FIO must offer a smoother integration experience to increase the number of integrations with existing wallets and exchanges. Currently, partner developers need ~240 hours to integrate FIO\u2019s full suite of functionalities. Recent efforts on developing a FIO Dashboard and a FIO Send API are set to significantly reduce partner integration work time to less than 20 hours. As more wallets and exchanges join the FIO ecosystem and best practices are established, the integration process will become more streamlined.\n\nSecond, FIO adoption is dependent on increasing usage frequency. FIO adoption could be jump started by creating behavioral hooks driven by habit-forming features, coupled with the continued adoption of DeFi.\n\nThird, as the space inevitably becomes more crowded, it will be important for FIO to cement its core value proposition to differentiate itself from other providers. That being said, the foundation has expressed a willingness to work collaboratively with a leading domain space competitor should one emerge. Its goal in this cooperation is to promote the seamless operation of FIO Crypto Handles in a decentralized domain namespace system, subject to block producer approval. If accomplished, FIO would position itself as the standard usability layer for transacting digital assets in the long term.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn a multichain world, users need an easy way to send and receive assets across blockchains. FIO aims to enable a homogeneous user experience that rivals Web2 usage without compromising on decentralization. It simplifies the sending, receiving, and requesting of digital assets. As of May 1, 2022, there were over 704,000 FIO Crypto Handles registered from over 58 partner integrations. The real test for FIO is to grow enough to achieve wide-scale community adoption as crypto becomes mainstream.\n\nThis report was commissioned by FIO, a member of Protocol Services.

The LME, owned by Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing, retroactively reversed these trades because China\u2019s Tsingshan Holding Group faced billions of dollars in losses.\n\nThis fiasco was effectively an advertisement for the Vega Protocol, a decentralized network for margined financial products. As a sovereign blockchain designed specifically for trading derivatives, Vega has developed novel approaches to fairness, risk monitoring and capital efficiency, while mirroring a centralized experience with its high performance. Also, beyond just preventing an event like the LME nickel debacle, Vega is tearing down the high barriers in traditional finance and much of crypto to enable permissionless, customizable market creation.\n\nCredible neutrality, risk management and open access are crucial for the $600 trillion (notional value) derivatives market. Although commonly written off as an outlet for financial speculation, derivatives play a vital role in economic growth and development. The 145-year-old London Metals Exchange, for example, is the largest derivatives market for base metals and helps metal producers and users mitigate the cash-flow volatility tied to price risk. In order for these important markets to remain useful and liquid, they must be functional and fair.\n\nVega Protocol founder Barney Mannerings, a computer scientist with 15 years of capital markets experience, saw the blockchain\u2019s role in building a better, more open financial system early on. But, having designed multiple releases of the London Stock Exchange\u2019s core trading system and matching engine, he didn\u2019t consider Ethereum\u2019s performance and other on-chain properties to be suitable for complex, high-performance trading. However, in early 2018, he realized he could build a well-functioning, decentralized trading network from scratch.\n\nNetwork Architecture\n\nToday, Vega is a standalone, custom-built, proof-of-stake blockchain that runs on the Tendermint consensus mechanism. Vega\u2019s network architecture is optimized for trading on several dimensions, starting with speed. Sophisticated trading systems need high throughput and low latency to support native order books and ensure that orders are priced correctly. Vega\u2019s consensus layer achieves this with its 1 second block time and ability to process thousands of transactions per block, with instant finality.\n\nThe architecture\u2019s second optimization deals with fees. Vega\u2019s mainnet will offer continuous trading through either an on-chain central limit order book (CLOB) or a hybrid design using both an automated market maker (AMM) and a CLOB. In this system, limit orders are valuable because they provide information and liquidity to the market. While generic blockchains charge fees based on the computing power needed to process a transaction, Vega wants to incentivize limit orders, so there is no fee to place orders on the Vega chain. Fees are only charged when orders execute. To prevent order spamming, Vega has implemented client-side proof-of-work for transactions, so as a user starts putting more orders into a block it becomes more expensive (in terms of effort in the proof of work) for a transaction to be accepted into the mempool.\n\nAnother issue facing DeFi is that entities such as miners often use the transparency of the blockchain to front-run profitable transactions. To neutralize this Vega designed an ordering protocol called Wendy. Wendy runs alongside consensus and uses the same trust assumptions about validators as proof-of-stake. So, if at least two-thirds of validators are honest about when they see messages, users can be assured that transactions will be ordered fairly.\n\nMarkets\n\nOn top of the Vega network lie its markets. In traditional finance, market makers and exchanges, such as Goldman Sachs and the CME Group, are gatekeepers that decide the \u2018who\u2019 and \u2018what\u2019 for market creation and trading. Vega disintermediates this process and allows anyone to create open (public) markets using customizable modules. This creation process is relatively accessible thanks to Vega\u2019s WebAssembly compiler, which lets participants build instruments and smart products with just about any high-level programming language. Since Vega markets are layered, prospective architects will start at the base, the product layer.\n\nAnother way to visualize markets on Vega. Source: Vega Whitepaper\n\nThe product layer allows anyone to pseudonymously create any type of market. Users can set up more traditional markets, such as spot swaps, futures, options, and perpetual swaps, or design new markets altogether, as long as they specify how to value the product and calculate settlement flows. The product creator must also specify when to calculate settlement, which could be as cash flows are generated (recurring), when positions are closed, or at an expiry date. Another important piece of product logic is the trading mode, which can range from open continuous trading through a CLOB to private, closed, over-the-counter (OTC) trades via off-chain matching. Finally, the user specifies the parameters (i.e., strike price, date of expiry, maximum leverage, etc.).\n\nOn top of the product layer, the next layer of abstraction that users can build on is the instrument layer. An instrument is just a product with filled parameters. An example is filling in the parameters for a generic call option product to create a BTC call option instrument; e.g., reference to a pre-approved oracle for the price of BTC, a strike price of $100,000, and an expiration date of 12/31/2022.\n\nFinally, to make the instrument tradable, it must be combined with one of Vega\u2019s risk models and appropriate values for the risk model\u2019s parameters. The risk model\u2019s main job is to determine the collateralization requirement for open positions. Once a tradable instrument has been proposed for open market listing, it will be voted on by Vega\u2019s on-chain governance.\n\nLiquidity and Market Making\n\nManaging liquidity is crucial for decentralized exchanges since insufficient liquidity makes it difficult to execute trades without significant price impact. Vega attempts to attract liquidity from different angles with the ultimate goal of providing valuable liquidity, meaning liquidity that trades.\n\nLiquidity pricing is based on open interest, trading volume, and current liquidity (i.e., order book depth), among other factors. The objective is to price liquidity so that it flows to markets that have the greatest need.\n\nLiquidity Supply vs. Cost of Liquidity. Source: Vega Whitepaper\n\nVega also uses an owner-operator model for market makers to steer liquidity to markets that need it. Market makers receive an equity-like stake in trading fees, proportional to the trading volume in a market when they added liquidity. Thus, market makers are incentivized to seed or create good markets and provide long-term support.\n\nBecause most open markets on Vega will trade continuously through the hybrid AMM-CLOB, a market maker can choose to either be active or passive. Active market makers, as the name suggests, actively manage pricing for their volume and must do so within a specified band around the last traded price. Passive market makers have their capital deployed automatically and algorithmically based on market prices. Even though CLOBs are much better than AMMs for trading derivatives, they are considerably worse for bootstrapping liquidity, so the AMM is an important complement in the early and illiquid phases of a market.\n\nBoth active and passive market makers will earn trading fees in exchange for providing liquidity. Trading fees will initially be bundled into a reward pool and then distributed to individual market makers based on their equity-like market share (stake in the trading fee pool), activity (active market makers with competitive prices earn more), and length of their market-making commitment. In general, fees will come from the price (liquidity) taker and be distributed to the price maker in the particular trade, infrastructure providers (validators), and, as outlined above, the market maker reward pool.\n\nAnyone can become a market maker as long as they provide a financial stake, using the traded assets, as a bond. If they fail to provide active volume in proportion to their financial stake, they are penalized and lose part of the stake to the insurance pool. This mechanism helps prevent liquidity shocks.\n\nTrading\n\nIrrespective of liquidity, new markets start in an auction setting to discover the initial price, before moving to their normal trading mode. During regular trading, protective auctions are a backup, only run when circuit breakers are triggered. These protective auctions start when a market crosses the predefined threshold (as defined by its risk model) for price volatility or low liquidity. Under such circumstances, auctions let participants figure out a fair market price or source liquidity.\n\nOnce an open market does find its initial price, it starts its normal trading mode. Continuous trading will either use a standard CLOB or a hybrid AMM-CLOB. Discrete trading translates into frequent batch auctions, introduced as a way to neutralize high-frequency trading.\n\nLess common but still useful are ad-hoc markets, which are closed (private), and usually created for one-off use. Commonly referred to as over-the-counter (OTC), in these trades, a party can advertise a trade and select the best bid (called a request for quote) or two parties can agree to a price off-chain (called a matched trade) and use the Vega network for execution and settlement.\n\nCollateral and Settlement\n\nThe first requirement when trading a margined financial instrument is to have sufficient collateral. This is especially important for Vega since all market participants operate under pseudonymity, so the protocol cannot gauge creditworthiness or have recourse. Since Vega doesn\u2019t have any native network assets, it needs to source collateral and trading capital from other chains. Even though Vega\u2019s use of Tendermint makes it a part of the Cosmos ecosystem, it was designed before the Cosmos SDK or Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC) and has not bridged to the Cosmos Hub due to the overhead from network requirements. Instead, Vega has its own Ethereum-based ERC-20 bridge, since Ethereum still holds the majority of liquid, tradable value. Any ERC-20 can be used as a market\u2019s base currency (for pricing, settlement, and margin).\n\nOnce a user has deposited collateral to Vega from the host chain they can place an order, which will reserve a certain amount of margin. If the order trades and a position is generated, Vega will start monitoring that position through its collateral manager module. Since there is no recourse if a trader owes more than their collateral, positions must be resolved while a trader\u2019s margin is greater than their loss. Hence, risk parameters such as initial margin (to open a position) and maintenance margin (to keep a position open) are stringent. However, rather than just bloating margin requirements, Vega uses live position monitoring, continuous risk recalculation, cross-margining, and (opt-in) automatic recapitalization to bolster capital efficiency.\n\nContinuous monitoring lowers margin costs because it compresses the time over which a position can move against a trader, so Vega ends up needing less collateral. Constant P&L monitoring also allows for cross margining, meaning that positions in profit can release some margin to offset losses and net margin across markets without having to close positions. The settlement engine also automatically sweeps funds back into a user\u2019s wallet once a position closes, and if a user opts in, it can also automatically sweep funds from a wallet into a position approaching its maintenance margin.\n\nAs soon as a trader\u2019s available collateral falls below the maintenance margin, the position is closed out. Referred to as \u201catomic closeouts,\u201d these instant liquidations by the protocol prevent further price movement against the position. Liquidations are designed so that positions are closed out with a net positive margin. This remaining sum is then added to the market\u2019s insurance pool to cover any position closed out with a negative balance.\n\nThe VEGA Token\n\nVEGA is the Vega Protocol\u2019s Ethereum-based, ERC-20 staking and governance token.\n\nVega is a delegated proof-of-stake blockchain, which means that the validator nodes running the network need to have, at least, a certain amount of VEGA staked. However, participants holding any balance of VEGA can delegate their stake to validator nodes. Stakers (validators and delegating token holders) earn a share of trading fees for securing and running the network, which means the fundamental value of VEGA will increase with the protocol\u2019s trading volume.\n\nUnlike most blockchains, traders on Vega are not required to buy and use VEGA to access the protocol since there are no gas fees.\n\nVEGA also allows tokenholders, whether they have delegated their tokens or not, to create and vote on governance proposals. Governance proposals cover the creation of new markets, the alteration of parameters in active markets, or changes in network (chain) parameters (e.g., the infrastructure fee given to stakers).\n\nMost token allocations have already started vesting and will vest linearly into late 2023. Locked tokenholders can still stake and vote.\n\nUp Next for Vega\n\nCurrently, there are two ways to use Vega: through the restricted mainnet or through Fairground, the third iteration (v3) of the Vega Protocol testnet. Vega\u2019s restricted mainnet, capped at 13 validators, only allows token staking/delegation and governance voting for the Alpha Mainnet. Fairground allows prospective users to try out some features using testnet assets, including market creation, liquidity provision, and continuous trading through the Vega Console (limited to cash-settled futures through a CLOB).\n\nIn the coming weeks, Vega will launch its Alpha Mainnet. Alpha Mainnet market creation and trading will be limited to CLOB-only cash-settled futures, with deposit limits and withdrawal delays for large sums. As the network proves to be secure, reliable and functioning as planned, restrictions will be phased out through on-chain governance.\n\nCompetition\n\nVega is a decentralized exchange (DEX), and given its wide scope, to allow permissionless trading and the creation of virtually any market, it technically competes against almost all DEXs. However, Vega\u2019s focus on margin trading means its core competitors are protocols focusing on perpetuals (e.g., dYdX, Perp), options (e.g., Dopex, Lyra), or a mix of markets such as GMX for spot swaps and perpetuals, and Zeta Markets for options and futures.\n\nCrypto Derivatives Competitive Landscape. Source: Jump Crypto\n\ndYdX is currently far and away the largest on-chain derivatives exchange by trading volume. dYdX only supports one product (perpetuals), has permissioned market creation and an off-chain, centralized order book and trade matching engine. Additionally, the dYdX governance token has virtually no value accrual. Nonetheless, dYdX has a valuable token and does over $1 billion in trading volume every day. Even though a large part of this volume comes from unsustainable trading incentives, some of its success is due to speed and usability that is comparable to centralized exchanges. However, dYdX is moving towards Vega\u2019s model with dYdX V4, which focuses on decentralization (order book, matching engine, market creation, etc.) and distributing trading fees to tokenholders.\n\nFrom a competitive point of view, dYdX\u2019s transition is mixed news for Vega. While dYdX V4 poses a competitive threat due to the overlap in specifications, it also leaves dYdX vulnerable during its transition. Additionally, we still don\u2019t know if fully decentralized, permissionless, on-chain derivatives really work or can compete against their centralized counterparts, since a lot of dYdX\u2019s volume has been bootstrapped through incentives and centralization. Whether or not Vega, or for that matter dYdX, will be able to attract meaningful volume to (fully) decentralized derivatives exchanges or fall prey to the same problems facing existing protocols, such as user experience (UX) complexity, high latency/flash crashes, and challenges around sourcing/placing liquidity is still an open question.\n\nRisks\n\nVega tries to solve some of these problems by introducing a modular trading interface (Vega Console), offering 1 second block times with high throughput and creating unique incentives around liquidity. However, there are still some unknowns, including UX friction and security concerns associated with cross-chain bridging and the (required) Vega Wallet. There is also uncertainty around the protocol\u2019s ability to execute high, organic volume across different product types and around the reliability of its first-of-a-kind liquidity model. Additionally, by bootstrapping its own network (blockchain), Vega doesn\u2019t inherit the security or composability/network effects of pre-existing monolithic chains (i.e., Ethereum, Solana, etc.). The security aspect, in particular, can result in a malicious actor taking control over the Vega network by subverting the consensus mechanism. Finally, Vega will face some of the same challenges as other on-chain derivatives exchanges around market manipulation and dubious/unreliable oracle data.\n\nClosing Thoughts\n\nThe London Metals Exchange (LME) nickel-trading fiasco could have been averted on an open, decentralized system like Vega.\n\nFor starters, on March 7th, the day before the contract cancellations, the price of nickel saw a 30 standard deviation move. Despite the extreme price move, LME governance failed to use its discretion to suspend trading. Vega, on the other hand, uses a transparent, preset threshold to trigger circuit breakers and move the market into a protective auction.\n\nLME\u2019s trades were canceled because the Tsingshan Holding Group, and others, could not meet margin calls and in some cases faced bankruptcy. In Vega, margin is continuously monitored, and stringent risk parameters ensure that the margin posted is always greater than a trader\u2019s loss, guaranteeing solvency. Once a trader\u2019s margin does fall below the minimum collateral requirement (maintenance margin), there is an instant, permissionless liquidation by the protocol, ensuring that the position stops moving against the trader.\n\nFinally, Vega runs on a blockchain. This means orders and liquidations are immutable, and no central authority can easily change the network\u2019s rules.\n\nIn the US equity market, options volume is 35 times that of spot, but in crypto, it\u2019s 2%, with most volume coming from centralized exchanges. This number means there is either a lack of demand or a massive opportunity, and given the dearth of good choices, the latter seems more likely. Vega wants to become a leading player in this space by solving the problems that plague on-chain derivatives: fragmentation, high latency, capital inefficiency, and poor liquidity management. If execution matches ambition, Vega has the opportunity to change the face of decentralized derivatives trading and become a centerpiece of DeFi.\n\nThis report was commissioned by Vega, a member of Protocol Services.

Each chain built within Polkadot uses Parity Technologies\u2019 blockchain development framework Substrate, which allows developers to select specific components that best suit their application-specific chain. Polkadot refers to the entire ecosystem of parachains that plug into a single base platform known as the Relay Chain. This base platform does not support application functionality but instead houses all validators and is responsible for securing, governing, and connecting the parachains.\n\nFollowing roughly five years of research and development, the first parachains were launched on Dec. 17, 2021. At Q1 2022 close, 13 parachains have won parachain slots bonding 127.8 million DOT (11% of the total supply, worth $2.9 billion). As the first edition of quarterly coverage on Polkadot, this report will highlight important developments since the launch of parachains and evaluate the network\u2019s Q1 performance. A full appendix of quarterly events and data is available at the end of the report.\n\nPrice History\n\nThe concept of parachains was first introduced in the Polkadot Paper in 2016. In October 2021, at the Substrate Sub0 conference, Co-Founder Robert Habermeier announced the Relay Chain was ready to support parachains. Over the following three weeks, the price of Polkadot\u2019s native token DOT increased 57% to an all-time-high of $55.08 ($56.5 billion market cap) on Nov. 5, 2021, one day after the community approved the first parachain slot auction for Nov. 11, 2021. However, Polkadot, along with the broader crypto market, saw valuations decrease from November 2021 through Q1 2022. DOT ended Q1 2022 at $22.5 ($23.3 billion market cap), down 60% from the all-time-high.\n\nDuring Q1 2022, Polkadot\u2019s valuation change was in range with changes in other ecosystems. LUNA was the largest gainer at +18%, FTM had the largest drop at -38%, and Polkadot had the third largest drop at -19%.\n\nNetwork Usage\n\nPolkadot user accounts, both new and active, followed a path similar to price. In November, user accounts were up 131% over the year-to-date average and recorded multiple all-time-highs. However, each month since November saw a drop in both active and new users accounts. Although the drop in user accounts was a common macro theme, some internal reasons were also responsible.\n\nThe decrease in active accounts may be the result of users locking their DOT for the two-year lease period to support their desired parachain(s) in a slot auction. DOT locked in a crowd loan is inaccessible and therefore cannot be used across Polkadot. To combat the liquidity constraint, parachains Acala and Parallel Finance have introduced liquid staking.\n\nThe decrease in new accounts may be related to the fact that the first batch of parachains generated significantly more excitement than the second batch. The first batch of parachains (1\u20135) had 342% more DOT bonded than the second batch of parachains (6\u201311).\n\nConversely, the number of addresses holding DOT increased every month of 2021 and Q1 2022. The increase signals healthy interest in the Polkadot ecosystem despite decreasing valuations.\n\nStaking and Decentralization\n\nPolkadot uses a Nominated Proof-of-Stake (NPoS) consensus mechanism. Nominated PoS consensus differs from Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPos) consensus because nominators, i.e. DOT owners who stake their tokens with a validator, are subject to slashing.\n\nValidators are paid every 24 hours for completing payable actions, known as era points. Every 4 hours, a subset of validators are randomly assigned to validate all parachains with a multiplier on the era points earned. The combination of era points and random parachain validation results in a probabilistic guarantee that validators earn nearly identical rewards. Because validators earn near equal rewards and distribute these rewards pro rata to their nominators, nominators are incentivized to stake with lower-staked validators to earn higher rewards. The validator-nominator reward model is designed to decentralize Polkadot\u2019s validator set. At Q1 2022 close, 294 of 297 (99%) of validators had 1.8\u20132.6 million DOT staked, confirming the nominator staking game theory is working.\n\nPolkadot uses an inflationary token model; therefore, there is no maximum number of DOT. Inflation rewards are distributed to validators for securing the Polkadot network, with the remainder going to the treasury. The inflation rate varies in relation to Polkadot\u2019s ideal staking rate, but averages approximately 10% annually. During Q1 2022, DOT maintained a consistent staking rate with a range of 53.8% to 58.6% of total DOT tokens staked.\n\nIt is possible for a single entity to run multiple validators. According to Subscan, in Q1 2022 there were seven entities running multiple validators, accounting for 20% of the total DOT staked. It is possible that additional entities are running multiple validators, but Subscan has not identified them.\n\nBecause of the even rewards distribution, running multiple validators nets a greater expected value. As a result, Polkadot validators self-bond the minimum of one DOT and nominate their DOT across a maximum of 16 validators to maximize the expected value of their staking rewards. Of the total DOT staked, roughly 99.7% is from nominators, and 0.3% is from validators self-bonding.\n\nParachain Auctions\n\nThe first parachain slot auction began on Nov. 11, 2021. At Q1 2022 close, 13 parachains won parachain slots bonding 127.8 million DOT (11% of the total supply, worth $2.9 billion). Polkadot has 28 new slot auctions scheduled through February 2023 (bringing the total to 41).  \n\nOf the first 13 parachains, seven are DeFi chains, three are smart contract platforms, and three are Web3 infrastructure chains. For a deeper look at each of the first 13 parachains, checkout the Polkadot Ecosystem Overview.\n\nPolkadot vs. Kusama\n\nAnother unique component of the Polkadot ecosystem is the canary network Kusama. Kusama is a sovereign blockchain with a nearly identical codebase and architecture as Polkadot; however, Kusama has a quicker governance mechanism with 7-day voting vs. Polkadot\u2019s 28-day voting. All new code rollouts are proposed, approved, tested, and implemented on Kusama before moving to Polkadot. As such, Polkadot and Kusama are closely related. Over the last five quarters, the market caps of both networks have closely tracked each other with a 0.797 correlation coefficient.\n\nConversely, user activity between the networks has little correlation. Over the last five quarters, the user accounts of both networks have had a weak 0.42 correlation coefficient. Both of the networks have seen user accounts trending downwards following the first Polkadot parachains.\n\nSimilar to the Kusama-Polkadot relationship, parachain project teams can launch a Kusama parachain to test new features under real economic conditions. Of the first 13 Polkadot parachains, 11 have Kusama parachains. On average, the Polkadot parachains locked ten times the USD value of the Kusama parachains. The lone exception was the Polkadot parachain Phala Network which had a greater USD value locked on its Kusama parachain Khala Network.\n\nDeveloper Overview\n\nPolkadot had the second largest developer community in 2021, according to the annual Electric Capital Developer Report. Polkadot began the year with 840 total developers and ended the year with 1,400 total developers, a net gain of 560 total developers (+67%). For comparison, Ethereum had the most developers with 3,920, and Cosmos had the third most with roughly 950.\n\nDeveloper activity through 2021 and Q1 2022 was consistent, with 14/15 months (93%) registering over 10,000 developer activity events. The exception, October 2021, was a result of developers shifting focus to supporting prospective parachains in anticipation of the inaugural auctions. Q1 2022 saw a 10% drop in average monthly developer activity as developers prioritized enabling previously deployed features rather than developing new features. Overall, Polkadot\u2019s developer activity is among the strongest in crypto.\n\nEcosystem Challenges\n\nIn Q4 2021, new users flooded Polkadot to partake in the inaugural, novel parachain slot auctions. However, excitement surrounding the ecosystem has steadily declined through Q1 2022.\n\nTo jumpstart excitement, Polkadot needs a spark, likely driven by a parachain or a protocol built on top of a parachain. A protocol needs to develop a new primitive(s) utilizing the cross-chain architecture and XCM communication. Developing new functionality and use cases will showcase the power of the network and organically attract users.\n\nAdditionally, users on the network often complain about the complexity of the Polkadot JS wallet. As of Q1 2022 close, multiple projects are working on a Polkadot ecosystem wallet including Talisman, SubWallet, Nova, and Polka Wallet.\n\nLastly, Polkadot suffers from a knowledge gap. The uniqueness of the architecture leads to common questions and comparisons with other open economy ecosystems. Polkadot could benefit from increased marketing and education efforts to combat common misconceptions.\n\nThe Road Ahead\n\nThe launch of Polkadot began in May 2020 with the Relay Chain genesis block and finished in December 2021 with the launch of parachains. Several post-launch developments and optimizations have been implemented in Q1 2022, and they are expected to continue through 2022.\n\nArguably the most important area of focus is the buildout of Polkadot\u2019s Cross-Consensus Message Format (XCM). XCM is a communication language allowing parachains to exchange messages with other parachains, similar to Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) on Cosmos. Kusama, Polkadot\u2019s canary network, has been testing a light client version of XCM, called HRMP. Expectations are that XCM will be implemented on Polkadot in Q2 2022. Update, Co-Founder Robert Habermeier tweeted on Apr. 17, 2022 that XCM would be launched on Polkadot during the next runtime upgrade.\n\nAnother area of focus is the launch of parathreads. Parathreads are pay-as-you-go parachains. Instead of always being connected to the Relay Chain like parachains, parathreads pay for the Relay Chain\u2019s security and interoperability as needed. Parathreads are useful for projects that do not wish to acquire a full parachain slot and/or existing parachains that no longer require a dedicated parachain slot.\n\nLastly, the developers will continue optimizing the network's performance. One major performance upgrade will come from Asynchronous Backing. It will allow parachains to build blocks concurrently with the relay chain and reduce the block time from 12s to 6s. Additional protocol updates are also in-development.\n\nClosing Summary\n\nThe marquee event of 2021 was the launch of parachains. Parachains going live led to all-time-highs in price, user accounts, and parachain slot auction contributions. Unfortunately, the euphoria was short lived, and each of these metrics experienced month-over-month declines through Q1 2022.\n\nDuring the same period, the foundational KPIs held steady. Polkadot maintained a healthy validator distribution by total stake, developer activity remained among the strongest in crypto, and users continued acquiring the token, signaling a healthy interest in the ecosystem.\n\nQ2 2022 will be characterized by additional parachains coming online and the rollout of XCM. To gain more market share, Polkadot needs a parachain or a protocol built on a parachain to take advantage of XCM and the cross-chain architecture by building a unique use case. Because parachains only launched 4 months ago, they are still in their early days.\n\nAppendix\n\n  \nEvents\n\nOctober 13, 2021 - Robert Habermeier Announces Parachains\nNovember 11, 2021 - First Parachain Auction Begin \nNovember 18, 2021 - Acala Wins 1st Parachain Slot \nNovember 25, 2021 - Moonbeam Wins 2nd Parachain Slot \nDecember 2, 2021 - Astar Wins 3rd Parachain Slot\nDecember 9, 2021 - Parallel Wins 4th Parachain Slot\nDecember 15, 2021 - Polkadot Re-Brand\nDecember 16, 2021 - Clover Wins 5th Parachain Slot\nDecember 17, 2021 - Parachains 1\u20135 Connected to Relay Chain\nDecember 30, 2021 - Efinity Wins 6th Parachain Slot\nJanuary 13, 2022 - Composable Wins 7th Parachain Slot\nJanuary 27, 2022 - Centrifuge Wins 8th Parachain Slot\nFebruary 2, 2022 - Report Polkadot Has Smallest Carbon Footprint\nFebruary 10, 2022 - HydraDX Wins 9th Parachain Slot\nFebruary 24, 2022 - Interlay Wins 10th Parachain Slot\nFebruary 24, 2022 - 30 Additional Auctions Scheduled\nMarch 10, 2022 - Nodle Wins 11th Parachain Slot\nMarch 19, 2022 - Equilibrium Wins 12th Parachain Slot\nMarch 31, 2022 - Phala Wins 13th Parachain Slot\n\n This report was commissioned by Polkadot, a member of Protocol Services.

Premia is designing its architecture based on these principles.\nThe protocol Smart Deposit Optimization Framework aims to make options strategies more accessible to a broader range of buyers.\nThe market that Premia operates in is in its infancy and its success will be dependent on protocols\u2019 ability to attract options buyers at scale.\n\nOptions are an important part of TradFi markets but have seen slow adoption in DeFi. However, DeFi options protocols have seen a general increase in interest in the last year, and particularly in the last month. On March 1st, the total value locked (TVL) across all option protocols was $446.6M and on March 31st, the TVL was $665.6M. While there were minimal fluctuations throughout the month, the TVL on option protocols increased nearly 50% in March.\n\nDeFi options vaults \u2013 think Yearn for options \u2013 in particular have become popular with retail investors. This is for good reason. They are accessible, relatively simple to use, and provide a high organic yield. By simply depositing their assets into a vault, ordinary investors get access to option premiums without having to deal with options directly. On top of the yield from option premiums, users may earn token rewards, and staking yield.\n\nDeFi options vaults come in two flavors, standalone and packaged with an AMM (peer-to-pool). The latter aims to aggregate liquidity across options series. However, AMMs were designed for spot trading. As such, these \u201cpeer-to-pool\u201d protocols had to modify the AMM pooled liquidity model to make it suitable for the convexity of options.\n\nPremia is a DeFi-native options protocol that has been generating particularly attractive returns for its users. Think mid-to-high double digits. It is taking an innovative approach to both AMM design and making DeFi options retail user friendly.\n\nIn this report we will give an overview of the Premia protocol, its secret sauce, tokenomics, traction, competitive landscape and risk factors. Let\u2019s start with a lay of the land on DeFi options protocols.\n\nLay of the Land on DeFi Options Protocols\n\nThere are two types of on-chain options protocols: market places and structured products. So far, structured product vaults have driven the large majority of the adoption.\n\nMarketplaces create the actual option contract and facilitate buying and selling. Protocols like Opyn, PsyOptions, and Zeta all operate a traditional order book.\n\nStructured product protocols sit on top of options marketplaces and offer vaults for users to deposit funds into. Each vault executes a defined options-based yield strategy. Similar to Yearn, these protocols are abstracting complexities away for the user. The most prominent structured product vaults engage in selling covered-calls and/or cash-margined puts.\n\nLiquidity pool marketplaces combine the two approaches, sourcing liquidity and underwriting options in the same protocol. They are also called \u201cpeer-to-pool\u201d marketplaces and typically utilize a liquidity pool (AMM) method vs. an order book.\n\nPremia falls into this category with its DeFi-native approach to options.\n\nOverview of Premia\n\nPremia\u2019s mission is to enable anyone to buy and sell American options in a fair and liquidity efficient way. It offers call and put underwriting through its vaults that are attracting retail investors looking for yield. The other side of the trade is taken by traders. Premia currently offers call and put markets for ETH, BTC, LUNA, YFI, LINK, ALCX, and alETH. The protocol is deployed on Ethereum, Arbitrum, and BSC. Its total value locked (TVL) on Ethereum, Arbitrum, and BSC is $6.34M, $8.81M, and $11.03K, respectively.\n\nThe Mechanics\n\nLiquidity Pools\n\nEach available asset pair has a call and a put pool. Call pools are underwritten in the underlying asset and put pools are underwritten in DAI. The two-pool structure gives LPs control over which strategies to underwrite. In other words, demand from buyers and sellers (strike price, expiration date, size) doesn\u2019t have to match. This is in stark contrast to the traditional order-book model where these parameters typically must align.\n\nTransaction Flow\n\nUsers simply specify the desired option details (option type, asset pair, strike, expiration date, quantity) and the pool returns a quote. Users then execute the trade in an on-chain transaction. The option is represented as an ERC-1155 token, allowing transfer or exercise at any time on or before expiration.\n\nThe ERC-1155 standard allows protocols to map unbalanced option rights and obligations between buyer and seller. It supports operations on unlimited numbers and types of non-fungible tokens within the same smart contract.\n\nExercising and Settlement\n\nOptions can be exercised at any time after purchase, in full or in part. If at the time of expiration an option is in-the-money, the payoff is locked in. It can then be claimed by the holder at any time post expiration. Options are cash-settled.\n\nA recently introduced Sell Feature allows traders to sell options back to the pool at any time. Previously, traders had to find a counterparty to accept the trade on an NFT marketplace to sell their options prior to expiration. This feature also benefits liquidity providers because they can pull their capital out early or place their capital in a new position, enabling them to earn on several positions.\n\nPool Accounting & LP Returns\n\nFIFO accounting. LPs select a pool and the amount they would like to deposit. Deposits are sequenced on a first-in, first-out basis. To facilitate this, all of the available liquidity (or \u201cFree Capital\u201d) in a pool, is sequenced in terms of intervals. Each interval is defined by: (1) LP wallet address, (2) interval number, (3) interval size (in monetary terms).\n\nA buy order will scan as many liquidity intervals as are needed to cover the position size. The transaction will mint ERC-1155 tokens for all LP interval owners involved. Once the option is purchased, each liquidity interval is updated. The transaction also mints an ERC-1155 token for the buyer, embedding all option parameters.\n\nOption exercise & settlement. When an option is exercised, the position is settled in the same transaction. The option holder receives the payoff, and the newly freed capital is returned to the pool.\n\nWithdrawals. Liquidity providers can withdraw their un-utilized free capital in a pool at any moment in time. If an LP would like to remove active (underwritten option) capital from a pool, they have two choices:\n\nPay the pool price to sell the option to another underwriter in the pool;\nUse the \u201cGradual Withdrawal\u201d feature to prevent their capital from being used to underwrite future options after expiration.\n\nHow does the protocol make money?\n\nPremia is charging fees to support the growth and long-term sustainability of the protocol:\n\nOption buyers are charged a 3% Protocol Fee at the time of purchase charged on the option\u2019s base price and included in the quote;\nLPs are charged a 2.5% Utilization Fee (see below).  \n\nA successful proposal recently replaced a 3% Exercise Fee with the Utilization fee. The problem with the Exercise Fee was that (1) it charged option buyers for a second time for the same transaction, and (2) there were no fees for options that expired out-of-the-money but did utilize capital. All of this resulted in unbalanced fee incentives.\n\nThe new Utilization Fee is a 2.5% annualized interest rate. It is calculated taking into account both the amount of capital locked and the period of time the capital was utilized. It is paid by the LP at settlement (exercise, secondary sale, or expiry) and taken from the collateral stored in the option.\n\nTo reward long-term supporters of the protocol, 80% of fees are paid as a protocol fee to $PREMIA stakers. The remaining 20% of fees go to the PREMIA treasury.\n\nProtocol expenses include Chainlink services (price feeds, nodes, keeper), The Graph\u2019s on-chain indexing and open-source DB/API service, and contract deployments. All of these must be maintained on a per-chain basis.\n\nPremia\u2019s Secret Sauce\n\nThe problem with using a spot AMM model for options\n\nPooled liquidity (AMM structure) has benefits. However, a simple bonding curve AMM only accounts for changes in token reserve. Options pricing takes multiple variables into account: spot price, volatility of the underlying asset, the risk free interest rate, and the strike price and duration of the option. All of these are dynamic and change on a trade by trade basis.\n\nTradFi options are typically priced using the Black-Scholes Model (BSM). To establish a robust equilibrium price in options AMMs it is important to both establish an accurate input for volatility and take into account market flows.\n\nVolatility is typically estimated by looking at both historical volatility and a live \u201cvolatility surface.\u201d The latter is a three-dimensional representation of the observed implied volatility of existing options on the asset from a range of strike prices and expiry dates. Volatility surfaces are complex to establish on-chain and either need to be held off-chain or approximated.\n\nPremia is offering a novel solution to these problems withs its implied volatility surface and c-level features. In addition, it aims to make DeFi options yields accessible to a broader audience. Through its smart deposit optimization framework, the protocol provides example portfolios to liquidity providers.\n\nLet\u2019s have a look at these key elements of Premia\u2019s \u201csecret sauce.\u201d\n\nImplied Volatility Surface\n\nA live implied volatility surface is crucial to providing an accurate approximation of the market-clearing price of an option based on the liquidity conditions present in DeFi markets. In absence of such a tool in DeFi, Premia launched its own Volatility Surface oracle. It is calculated off-chain and periodically reports the updated surface via Chainlink. To construct the surface, Premia uses a volume-weighted combination of the most liquid CEX options data, together with data from trades executed on the Premia platform.\n\nThe image above depicts the volatility surface of a BTC call option circa October 2021. Source: Premia Gitbook\n\nC-Level\n\nThe C-level is an equilibrium mechanism to address shortcomings of the BSM, which uses simplified assumptions that ignore (1) market supply and demand, (2) \u201cAmerican\u201d style exercise, and (3) asset-specific volatility dynamics. The mechanism is a coefficient that fluctuates based on real-time liquidity and demand for buying options. When the coefficient is multiplied by the BSM-determined option price, it adjusts the price levels in option pools to market supply and demand.\n\nSmart Deposit Optimization Framework\n\nThe smart deposit optimization framework provides portfolio optimization for LPs. This framework gives LPs example portfolios which may help optimize yield according to local market supply and demand conditions. It allows users to automatically optimize their pool deposits to have the minimum impact on pool price levels.\n\nThe $Premia Token\n\nPremia\u2019s $PREMIA token is an ERC-1155 utility and governance token.\n\nPremia\u2019s token\u2019s supply is fixed at 100 million. The initial token distribution of 10 million PREMIA tokens was conducted on February 7, 2021. Of the remaining 90 million tokens, 10 million were allocated to its founding team. Furthermore, Premia allocated 20% to its Development Fund, 5% to marketing and education, and 5% to ecosystem grants.\n\nAccording to CoinGecko, the circulating supply is currently $10.6M. The circulating supply does not include the 10 million allocated to the founding team as these are still locked in a vesting schedule. Premia\u2019s fully diluted market capitalization, which is the value of the entire token supply at current prices, is $167million at the date of publication.\n\n$PREMIA accrues value to token holders through its liquidity mining program and staking mechanisms. Premia\u2019s Cross-Chain Liquidity Mining Fund received the highest token allocation at 30%. Liquidity providers receive $PREMIA tokens as compensation for lending their assets. $PREMIA stakers collect the bulk, an estimated 80%, of the protocol\u2019s fees. All $PREMIA holders receive governance rights, which means that they can vote on new proposals and protocol decisions. Those who own at least 100 $PREMIA tokens can submit Community Proposals regarding changes to Premia\u2019s features and the protocol\u2019s future roadmap.\n\nTraction and Competitive Landscape\n\nTraction\n\nPremia\u2019s TVL is comparatively lower than top options protocols like Dopex and Ribbon Finance. However, Premia does seem to optimize capital efficiency effectively. Taking Dune data for Premia\u2019s ETH, WBTC, and Link pools it produces 25% annualized return on assets (ROA) for March 2022. This compares to 3.6% for Yearn and 30% for Ribbon over the same period.\n\nCompetitive Landscape\n\nThe table below compares Premia to its main competitors that employ a similar peer-to-pool model. Although smaller in terms of TVL, Premia is the only such protocol offering options with American exercise. The fungibility of its tokens also stands out.\n\nThe information above was sourced from multiple sources, including the Premia Gitbook, Dopex Gitbook, Lyra Gitbook, Etherscan, and DeFi Llama.\n\nRisks\n\nUser adoption\n\nThe on-chain DeFi options model is still in its infancy. Although retail demand for yield is strong, the challenge is in finding the other side of the trade on-chain. Protocols like Ribbon find buyers off-chain (typically market makers). Shifts in user behavior are crucial for protocols like Premia to scale.\n\nAmerican-style options are a double-edged sword\n\nAmerican-style exercise is the most popular in TradFi and Premia is the only protocol offering American options on EVM. However, American options are harder to price and also carry more LP risk. American options are more challenging to price because the traditional Black-Scholes pricing model neglects the asset\u2019s fluctuating valuation up until expiry. Other option pricing models designed for American options include the Tree/Binomial pricing model, which could be difficult to incorporate on decentralized platforms. American options incur LP risk from potential liquidity deficiencies as a result of early exercise. The Premia team attempts to mitigate this risk with its incentives structure, which is designed to attract LPs when liquidity is low.\n\nCompetition\n\nPremia also faces competition from both alternative DeFi derivatives instruments like perpetual swaps (perps) and competitors that use the more dominant options vault model that Ribbon employs.\n\nDifferentiation\n\nLike in any market, differentiation vs. competitors is key in attracting a captive client base. One way for Premia to differentiate could be to support popular tokens before its competitors. This has paid off for Dopex which supported OHM early.\n\nConclusion\n\nDeFi options markets are still in their infancy. The traction that these options markets have picked up in the last few months are mostly on the supply side. Liquidity providers are discovering that option protocols offer better yields than some legacy DeFi platforms, which is driving up TVL and volume on DeFi options platforms.\n\nHowever, the demand for options is still lagging. Although this introduces challenges, it also creates opportunities for protocols like Premia to innovate.\n\nIf the demand for options in DeFi markets eventually resembles the demand in TradFi markets, then Premia does not need to capture a significant chunk of the market share to do well. Instead, Premia\u2019s future relies on how it adapts to market conditions and develops cutting-edge features.\n\nThis report was commissioned by Premia, a member of Protocol Services.

Markets last week were showing signs of consolidation, which could indicate that big moves would be coming ahead. Judging from market sentiment, the moves could be in the downward direction. Losses this week ranged from -2.24% to -11.06% as the gaming sector took the biggest hit.\n\nTop Assets\n\nDogecoin (DOGE) was the only top asset by market capitalization that ended the week with a positive return. Just like the rest of the assets within the category, DOGE was trending downwards mid-week and was heading towards a 10% loss. However, markets went on a brief rally, and the original dog coin saw its price rise by as much as 36.2% following news that Elon Musk would be acquiring Twitter. DOGE has given back most of the gains since and finished the week just slightly above where it started (1.2%). \n\nDeFi Assets\n\nThe top DeFi sector assets went through a decline this week with the exception of two outliers \u2014 Kava (KAVA) and Curve (CRV). CRV started the week on solid footing as it achieved a 15% gain quickly and subsequently peaking at 22% by mid-week. The token lost momentum soon after and its price started to taper off; however, this was enough to secure its position in second place. On the other hand, KAVA, the Tendermint-based Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain\u2019s native asset, started the week around -5% territory but recovered lost ground and followed a steady trend upwards, only surpassing CRV\u2019s price at the last moment. It was the sector leader this week with a 15.1% return.\n\nSmart Contract Platforms\n\nIt was all red for the smart contract platform sector as all of its top assets finished the week underwater. Losses this week ranged from -1.1% all the way down to -20.3%. Ethereum (ETH) declined the least within the sector. Its token price visited the 5% decline territory at one point but was able to recover lost ground, finishing the week slightly below where it started. Interestingly, the two projects which recently announced that they will be launching their own native LUNA/UST-like algo stablecoins were the biggest losers this week. TRON (TRON) and NEAR (NEAR) ended the week with corresponding 11.3% and 20.3% declines.\n\nCurrencies\n\nSimilar to the top assets by market capitalization category, the currencies sector only had one asset end the week with a positive return. Dogecoin (DOGE) has benefitted from the string of media coverage that one of its biggest proponents, Elon Musk, has recently been receiving. News that Twitter accepted Elon Musk\u2019s buyout offer was enough to propel DOGE 36.2% from its weekly low. Although most of the gains have been returned, it was enough to secure the leading position within the sector. \n\nWeb3\n\nThe Web3 sector had a rocky week as most of the top assets had significant price action. Only The Graph (GRT) was able to end the week in positive territory. The decentralized indexing protocol\u2019s token ended the week with a 2.2% return. The rest of the sector\u2019s top assets saw losses ranging from 4.7% down to 14.7% with Theta Network\u2019s THETA token being the laggard of the group.\n\nGaming\n\nThe gaming sector was the worst performer of the week and the only one with a double-digit decline (11.1%). The sector appeared on track to have all its top assets end the week in the red; however, Yield Guild Games\u2019 token YGG had a 20% price rally at the last moment that was enough to secure its position as the top performer with a 2.3% return. Axie Infinity (AXS) lagged the group this week with a 17.3% decline.\n\n", "references": [{"name": "Guillermo Avil\u00e9s", "url": ""}], "published_at": "2022-04-29T14:21:00Z", "author": {"name": "Guillermo Avil\u00e9s"}, "tags": ["Macro"], "url": "https://messari.io/article/weekly-recap-ending-april-28"}, {"id": "2b66e512-0bf9-42ed-af2b-d885b7df07b7", "title": "State of Decentral Games Q1 2022", "content": "Download the PDF version of this report by clicking here.pdf).\n\nInteract with the real-time data that created this report on the Dune Analytics dashboard.\n\nIf you would like to view the full recording of the live Crowdcast event, you can find it on our YouTube channel or read the transcript.\n\nKey Insights\n\nWith over 12,000 daily active users, Decentral Games is more active than most decentralized metaverses.\nDecentral Games operates on Polygon and is integrated within the Polygon Studios gaming and NFT ecosystem.\nICE Poker is the main game in the Decentral Games ecosystem. It earned $36 million in Q1 2022 from NFT activations, NFT mints, secondary sales fees, and in-game upgrades fees.\nImportant governance decisions made in Q1 2022 include adding in-game ads, featuring NFT mints in ICE, the native in-game currency, instead of ETH, and changing reward distributions.\nThe forthcoming launch of a simplified game mode via mobile app is expected to further increase the game\u2019s user base.\n\nPoker rooms typically make their revenue from commission fees called a rake. It\u2019s the cost of doing business, but there\u2019s usually still some disgruntlement by players about this; after all, the operator is effectively applying a tax on the game. So what about a poker room where a rake doesn\u2019t need to be applied? Or even, what about a poker room where players don\u2019t have to lose anything at all?\n\nDecentral Games in a Nutshell\n\nDecentral Games is a game operator within Decentraland, a 3-D browser-based world. It\u2019s designed to reward users through a play-to-earn mechanism. Those who commit time to play the game are given the means to build a collection of assets worth real-world money. Both fungible and non-fungible assets are incorporated within Decentral Games \u2014 users can self-custody assets, earn yield-based rewards, and take ownership of their in-game items.\n\nUnderneath the hood, Decentral Games uses Polygon as its scaling solution. A multifaceted partnership exists between the two entities: Decentral Games deploys its games on the Polygon network and is a member of Polygon Studio\u2019s ecosystem. The game platform also runs its own Polygon node.\n\nThe most successful game offered in the Decentral Games ecosystem is ICE Poker. It\u2019s where the focus of the development team \u2014 and of this report \u2014 resides. ICE Poker was launched in October 2021 and is based on Texas hold\u2019em, one of the most popular poker variations. Hold\u2019em was chosen with the intent to bring in more users. ICE Poker aims to tap into an existing player pool by not requiring users to learn a new game. As a result, ICE Poker is among the most active and fastest-growing decentralized virtual worlds.\n\nICE Poker had approximately 8,000 daily active users in Q1 2022, up over 500% from the previous quarter. Not only did the ICE Poker game see a surge in users, the metric only reflects the average over the quarter and not the trend. The trend, meanwhile, highlights a steady increase in daily active users. Reaching 10,000 daily users for the first time in Q1 2022 is good evidence that ICE Poker is overcoming the usual lack of users that most decentralized metaverses face.\n\nNotably, the last day of Q1 2022 did see a significant dip after reaching 12,000 daily active users before sharply rebounding in the beginning of April. This date coincided with the launch of a new feature, Assigned Seating, which launched with a few errant software bugs. Demand for Assigned Seating had been considerable, and after the bugs were fixed, daily users returned back to previous levels.\n\nWearable NFTs and Gameplay\n\nTo play ICE Poker, one needs to own or rent at least one in-game digital asset, i.e., a wearable NFT. Each wearable NFT starts as an ICE Rank 1 item (beginner) and can be upgraded up to ICE Rank 5 (colloquially known as diamond hand NFTs). Higher-ranked NFTs collect more rewards, which are paid out in ICE, the native in-game token. To move from one rank to another, owners must spend both ICE tokens and XP earned from completing gameplay challenges to level up their assets.\n\nSource: Decentral Games\n\nPlayers have the option of owning wearable NFTs outright (i.e., player-owner) or renting them (i.e., delegated player) from other NFT owners. Those with outright ownership may either acquire newly minted wearable NFTs or purchase them on secondary marketplaces like OpenSea (secondary sales). Ultimately, the decision remains a personal one. Poker players who are invested may want ownership of their own assets; meanwhile, metaverse \u201ctourists\u201d can choose to play without making any initial financial commitment. While delegated players face less risk, they have to split some of their earnings with the NFT owner.\n\nPlayer Metrics and Rewards\n\nAlmost all games with in-game economies suffer from inflationary pressures. ICE Poker is no exception: as players spend more time in the game and rank higher on the leaderboard, they are more likely to receive greater ICE rewards. With ICE Poker finishing up its first full quarter, it\u2019s worth tracking relevant in-game metrics. Let\u2019s start by understanding the economic incentives for players first.\n\nA visualization of the ecosystem\u2019s economic engine is shown above. By accessing a wearable NFT, a player gets a daily allocation of chips. These chips can only be used for playing poker within ICE Poker. Notice players themselves don\u2019t need to wager bets to play ICE Poker. Winning is measured in the number of ICE tokens earned. This essentially gives players a risk-free seat at the table: provided that players put the necessary time and effort into playing well, there is only upside potential. Each player is incentivized to perform a daily check-in, complete three daily challenges, and play well in exchange for ICE tokens and XP rewards. Gameplay rewards are calculated as follows:\n\nBased on each player\u2019s ranking on the daily leaderboard, a performance multiplier is applied to their earnings, which are paid in ICE. The higher a player ranks, the higher their ICE earnings.\nPlayers may also get ICE based on their wearable NFTs. There are five different wearable NFT ranks, each with corresponding rewards.\nAt the end of each month, players who are at the top of the leaderboard can earn additional DG tokens, granting them increased governance and fee share in the DG ecosystem.\n\nDecentral Games incentivizes ICE Poker players to reinvest their gameplay rewards into their own wearable NFT portfolios. Acquiring NFTs by primary sales requires people to mint the NFTs upon release. As of April 28, 2022, there have been 12 drops of ICE wearable NFTs dating back to November 2021. Each NFT drop is pegged with an associated label: recent names have been ICE Cyberpunk, ICE Spartan, and ICE Poet. Labels primarily exist to distinguish when the NFT was minted and don\u2019t have any impact on functionality.\n\nBy opting for a controlled NFT release schedule, Decentral Games believes its vertical progression is more sustainable than the burning-to-breed models of other games. Supply is actively managed without the risk of exponential growth. Notably, most mints are uniformly distributed among buyers, with 50% of new NFTs ending up in wallets with only one wearable. That number surges even higher to 91% when filtering for new mints ending up in wallets with two or fewer total wearables.\n\nA study of mint prices compared to the secondary sales price shows an opportunity for users to make a quick buck. In each of the 11 NFT drops we analyzed, the average secondary sales price was higher than the mint price. However, recent mints have become more expensive. For example, the average mint price of the first eight NFT drops was $1,237, while the average price for the last three NFT drops was $4,070. The higher starting price cuts into the eventual profits from flipping on the secondary market and encourages minters to utilize the NFT for non-speculative purposes instead.\n\nPoker Participants\n\nAfter renting or purchasing at least one wearable NFT, any user is granted table access. And although users can choose to either rent or purchase their wearable NFTs to gain table access, the ICE Poker ecosystem gains more when users purchase their NFTs. To incentivize player-owners to invest more resources into the ecosystem, ICE Poker encourages its users to upgrade their wearable NFTs.\n\nNotably, over the past months, it has become increasingly affordable for player-owners to upgrade their wearable NFTs. Although a higher ICE Rank still costs more to upgrade than a lower ICE Rank, the price gaps are starting to shrink. The lower prices may have incentivized player-owners to upgrade more often.\n\nIndeed, the general price decrease of upgrades coincided with a weekly 15% increase in the number of upgrades in recent months. It may thus be fair to discuss what benefits upgrades bring to player-owners. One might hypothesize that upgrades may correspond to generally higher prices for rarer wearable NFTs \u2014 intuitively, Rank 5 wearable NFTs should be more expensive to acquire on secondary markets than, for instance, those of Rank 1.\n\nHowever, upon inspecting secondary sales prices, wearable NFT prices generally stabilize around the $5,000 range. On average, Rank 1 NFTs sold for the lowest prices, followed by Rank 5 NFTs. Conversely, NFTs of Ranks 3 and 4 sold for the highest prices. While this may be partly related to sample size, the behavior is still a surprising one.\n\nPart of the explanation might be due to supply and demand. There were 3,487 sales of Rank 1 NFTs and 910 sales of Rank 5 NFTs in Q1 2022. Those volumes were multiples of the count for Rank 4 NFTs, which only had 79 transactions. Even Rank 3 NFTs only had 117 sales.\n\nAnother reason may be due to the gameplay itself. Purchasing a Rank 5 NFT could be seen as \u201ccheating\u201d the system; hardcore players might take this route to maximize reward, despite missing out on upgrade objectives. Altogether, there were 4,979 secondary sales in Q1 2022, which is significantly lower than the 9,477 total mints. These numbers suggest that there is not much selling activity \u2014 newly minted NFTs don\u2019t usually change hands. Instead, player-owners are active poker players or have started to transition towards being guild owners who rent their wearable NFTs to other participants.\n\nWhile gameplay requires a certain time investment, lending out wearable NFTs requires managing the performance of delegated players. The better those delegated players perform, the more revenue is accrued by a player-owner. Guild owners may find the second option attractive by choosing to delegate their guilds.\n\nGuild Owners\n\nICE Poker enables guild owners to maximize their returns by tracking the performance of the delegated players via the Delegation Dashboard. Importantly, guilds don\u2019t necessarily need to be wallets with dozens of NFTs; in the ICE poker ecosystem, a wallet with a single delegated NFT counts as a guild for the game\u2019s tracking purposes.\n\nOn-chain data shows there are more than 4,000 guild wallets, making up 23% of all ICE Poker NFT-owning wallets. Approximately 1,500 of those guild wallets delegate one wearable NFT; another 1,500 delegates out two to four; and 600 rent out five to nine wearables. The resulting 400 guilds manage more than 10 wearables.\n\nThis data confirms Decentral Games\u2019 aim of ensuring the gameplay ecosystem remains healthy in the long term. In this sense, ICE Poker did not do any pre-sale over-the-counter deals for industry insiders. Instead, ICE Poker wearable NFT drops were designed with a wide distribution in mind to incentivize gamers instead of tokenholders. That is, the goal is to incentivize the 77% of gameplay wallets to acquire their in-game wearable NFTs through organic mints or secondary sales. In doing so, the revenues generated by ICE Poker can be better sustained.\n\nICE Poker In-Game Economy\n\nApproximately six months after the game\u2019s launch, cumulative revenue from ICE Poker wearable NFTs reached over $40 million in Q1 2022. Minting accounts for the majority of ICE Poker revenue. In fact, almost 93% of ICE Poker revenue corresponds to mints and upgrades. The remaining 7% accounts for secondary sales and activations \u2014 this shows that only a small portion of revenues are accrued from the changing hands of wearable NFTs. Instead, once a wearable NFT is minted, most owners don\u2019t sell them and prefer to use them in-game or rent them out.\n\nOn a daily basis, mint revenue can be overrepresented on NFT drop days. Those particular days are vital for the protocol because revenue from mints comprises more than 70% of ICE Poker\u2019s cumulative revenue. For days without mints, upgrades then make up the majority of daily revenue.\n\nThe remaining two revenue streams (secondary sales and activations) make up for only a small fraction of protocol revenue. Combined, they max out to 50% of daily revenue but typically fall around 25% or less. This upgrade-heavy revenue model hints toward a healthy in-game economy where users are incentivized to upgrade, instead of cashing out and passing on their wearable NFTs to the next player.\n\nHolistically, ICE Poker\u2019s monetization strategy is analogous to those perfected by high-growing consumer tech companies. The first step is user acquisition, which is where ICE Poker is today. Once users are brought into the product and scale is achieved, activations and secondary sales may potentially become more tangible sources of revenue \u2014 and not just any revenue, but a recurring revenue that yields higher valuations and protocol stability.\n\nGovernance Updates\n\nThe management of the DG lounge is mostly left up to stakers of the DG token. Governance participants can vote on the use of proceeds, whitelist logic, partnerships, gameplay factors (such as point multipliers), and more. The following is a series of approved governance decisions with high protocol impact:\n\nJan. 21, 2022 \u2014 Update ICE Poker Rewards Split to Incentivize Upgrades and Player Ownership\n\nAll delegated NFTs followed the same reward split prior to this governance decision: the delegator would receive 30% of the rewards while the player always earned 70% of the profits. Note this system ignores NFT rank. This governance decision changes that distribution. Voters believed owners should also earn a higher percentage of the reward since they bear the full cost of upgrading the NFT. The new split for wearable delegators will be as follows:\n\nRank 1 \u2014 40%; Rank 2 \u2014 43%; Rank 3 \u2014 46%; Rank 4 \u2014 49%; and Rank 5 (Diamond Hands) \u2014 52%.\n\nFeb. 5, 2022 \u2014 Allow Partnered Metaverse Advertised in ICE Poker Venues\n\nA decision to approve advertisements (images, video, or audio) was made by governance at the beginning of February 2022. Advertisements are to be placed in strategic but non-intrusive locations within a few of the ICE Poker venues. The first location was the Stronghold venue, followed by the implementation of advertisements in the DEXT Lounge and Chateau Satoshi as well. Payment to Decentral Games will be made through stablecoins that will fund token buyback or LP revenue.\n\nFeb. 6, 2022 \u2014 Lower Bars to Post and Pass a Proposal\n\nFaced with high governance participation barriers, staked tokenholders voted to lower bars to post and pass proposals. Following the approved vote, the number of xDG needed to make a proposal fell from 1.9 million xDG to 100,000 xDG, increasing the count from 33 to 185 wallets that were eligible to make proposals. The quorum to approve decisions also fell from 38 million xDG to 10 million xDG, making proposals easier to pass.\n\nMar. 26, 2022 \u2014 Price the Next NFT Drop in ICE Tokens Instead of ETH\n\nIce Poker NFT Drop #8, the one titled ICE Beach Day, was priced in ICE tokens instead of ETH as a result of this governance vote. It was the first NFT drop to do so, and NFT Drop #10 (ICE Poet) was also priced in ICE. Denominating the sale in ICE encourages minters to purchase ICE and gives the protocol the ability to recalibrate token supply. Future mints will also likely be priced in either ETH or ICE.\n\nRoadmap\n\nTo further expand the DG ecosystem, the development team has three core priorities for the upcoming quarter: solidify in-game tokenomics, improve the gameplay of ICE Poker, and launch a mobile-first application for on-the-go accessibility.\n\nSolidify ICE Poker Game Economics\n\nAny successful game design relies on sustainable in-game economics. If designed poorly, games face virtual inflation, which occurs when long-time players accumulate enough in-game capital to make purchases unattainable for new players. This inflation drives new players away from the game and slows the game\u2019s growth.\n\nThis type of inflation is a relevant concern for ICE Poker. Balancing in-game currencies, NFT sales, and new mints necessitate game faucets to ensure that the issuance and burns are well-balanced. While this is an ongoing focus area, some ideas implemented by the team are higher stakes poker competitions, non-ICE NFT wearables, and custom NFT emotes.\n\nScale Gameplay of ICE Poker\n\nHaving previously experimented with various games, Decentral Games found poker to be the standout hit that attracted \u2013 and retained \u2013 users. A continued goal of the Decentral Games team, therefore, is to build out features designed to improve gameplay on ICE Poker.\n\nFor example, the team shipped the Assigned Seating feature which went live on March 31. It was put in place to stop players from choosing their specific seating at an active game. Since positioning is critical for a turn-based game like poker, this new feature reduces collusion opportunities between friendly parties. The development team plans to continue adding or tweaking elements to improve its game.\n\nInaugurate ICE Poker Mobile\n\nA mobile version of ICE Poker is expected to be launched in Q2 2022. The on-the-go gameplay option will allow the team to attract new users and keep existing users engaged. The Decentral Games team has explicitly called this an important milestone to \u201conboard the next 30,000 players into the DG ecosystem.\u201d\n\nBased on public announcements, it seems that ICE Poker Mobile and the browser-based metaverse will share the same in-game currency and rewards mechanisms; however, ICE Poker Mobile will be an abbreviated 2-D version of the game. The result of that decision will be shorter gameplay times, lower entry costs, and smaller in-game rewards.\n\nClosing Summary\n\nIf the metaverse is defined by anything, it\u2019s by a surplus of ideas and a shortage of users. Even on the user front, emerging technologies might find an old adage to hold true: attracting users is easy; retaining users is hard. When people finally choose to explore virtual worlds out of curiosity, will they continue to come back to it, day after day, week after week?\n\nThe main takeaway for Decentral Games\u2019 Q1 is straightforward. It\u2019s still too early to make predictions, but their current ability to draw thousands of daily active users is impressive. A big part of that may be what they\u2019re building (poker has historically been quite successful). Yet with continued design efforts, gameplay improvements, and a mobile app launching next quarter, Decentral Games and their ICE Poker metaverse are set up for continued near-term growth.\n\nThis report was commissioned by Decentral Games, a member of Protocol Services.

The team innovated Protocol Controlled Value, using protocol-owned equity to backstop the algorithmic incentives it had created to manage a stablecoin peg. Because PCV is not debt or seigniorage, there is no risk of a liquidation event or death spiral. The risk lies in the fidelity and volatility of the PCV\u2019s assets, relative to the outstanding liabilities in minted stablecoins. The Fei Protocol PCV consists of decentralized assets and is currently deployed to provide liquidity and earn yield. The \u201ccollateral ratio,\u201d which measures circulating FEI supply to PCV, is a key metric in determining the credibility of the peg. Fei V2 was announced in October 2021, removing the direct incentives mechanism in favor of 1:1 redeemability of FEI for decentralized assets ETH, DAI, and LUSD. The DAO manages the reserve pools that back these mint/redeem mechanisms, currently with a 50 bps spread. As part of V2, the DAO aligned TRIBE (the project governance token) with the stablecoin as seigniorage. TRIBE now benefits from the PCV\u2019s earnings in the form of buybacks, while also playing backstop (seigniorage) if the PCV can\u2019t backstop the existing stablecoin supply. In January 2022, Fei Protocol merged with Rari Capital to form Tribe DAO.\n\n  \n  \n  \n\nQuarterly Discussion\n\nThe State of Fei\nFei-Rari Merger\nFEI stablecoin performance and adoption\nPCV Management\nTribe Token\nLaaS\nRoadmap\n  Turbo\n  xTribe\n  Other Key Announcements\nConcluding Thoughts and Questions\n\nThe State of Fei\n\nFei is a protocol in transition \u2014 both in its utilization and structure, with the creation of Tribe DAO and merger between Fei Protocol and Rari Capital. FEI is a fully functioning stablecoin that is in its own category. Unlike most stablecoins, FEI is certainly not centralized. FEI is not a purely algorithmic stablecoin. Neither is FEI a collateralized stablecoin, as there is no debt or collateral involved. Instead, FEI can be thought of as a reserve-backed stablecoin.\n\nThe team innovated Protocol Controlled Value, which is different from collateral because it is owned and controlled by the DAO. The original design attempted to pair this PCV with an algorithmic design, using direct incentives to manage the peg with the PCV as a backstop. Despite being an innovative design and highly touted project, it did not function as desired. Fortunately, Fei was able to pivot and use 1:1 minting and redeemability of PCV for FEI within a band to maintain the peg, the design it currently uses.\n\nUsing the reserve-backed stablecoin model we can explain the balancing forces for the stablecoin peg. The reserve ratio is the ratio of total PCV relative to total FEI supplied, which includes the circulating supply and the protocol-owned supply. Intuitively, this model holds because the equity value owned by the protocol must be greater than or equal to the value that the protocol has added to the market via FEI. Empirically, it is unclear if this model will hold given the limited data, and likely needs to include an interest rate assumption for completion. In Q1, the reserve ratio dropped below 1 in January. It did correspond with downward pressure on the peg and redemptions of FEI for PCV, though the difficult market environment makes the actual causes unclear.\n\nThe reserve-backed stablecoin framework is also useful for framing Tribe DAO\u2019s future plans. The collateral ratio (PCV relative to circulating FEI) reports how much \u201cdry powder\u201d the protocol has to mint and deploy FEI stablecoins productively. This is the liquidity engine that Fei Protocol created: the DAO can both earn yield on PCV assets while minting FEI against them to create and utilize protocol-owned FEI. The marriage with Rari Capital (and the New Year resolution tweet) clarifies the intentions for protocol-owned FEI: to use the lending platform and liquidity engine to become a liquidity provider for DAOs by offering cheap stablecoin liquidity to Rari lending pools. This is an extremely powerful proposition given the state of the PCV and size/growth potential of the market.\n\nDAO treasuries are currently measured at over $9 billion. As the crypto market matures and grows so should treasuries, giving Tribe DAO the opportunity to grow into an expanding market. With the launch of Turbo in the second quarter and other future products leaked, all pitched as solutions for DAO liquidity and treasury management, the team  showing no shortage of products to utilize existing PCV to be deployed as productive protocol-owned FEI, which should increase value for the DAO.\n\nA fundamental question going forward will be how will the DAO grow the PCV. As discussed above, Tribe DAO plans to use existing PCV to provide DAOs with liquidity. However, there is no roadmap yet for increasing demand to minting new user-owned FEI in exchange for reserve assets. The latter would require increased FEI demand and adoption. The upside, of course, is deeper, more liquid markets and greater adoption for a decentralized stablecoin. It would also mean a larger PCV. The downside is the impact on the collateral and reserve ratios. The products so far announced utilize the PCV by supplying FEI to the market with novel products that should drive returns on PCV, but they do not necessarily create incentives for FEI demand.\n\nThe teams at both Fei Labs and Rari Capital have proven to be proficient and indefatigable in their product innovation, design, and launch (i.e., the devs ship) both individually and now combined under Tribe DAO. Although the current direction of the project is becoming clear, there are still some questions and opportunities in the long term. Currently, the project is well-funded with a strong balance sheet position and new products coming to market.\n\nThe DAO Merger\n\nOn November 16, 2021, Joey Santoro (co-founder of Fei) and Jai Bhavnani (co-founder of Rari) proposed a merger of the two protocols. The final snapshot vote to tie the two was completed in January this year, forming the Tribe DAO. As of March 31, 2022, over 5.7 million RGT (Rari Governance Token), around 47% of the supply, has been exchanged for roughly 152 million TRIBE at an exchange ratio of 1:26.7. RGT holders have until August 1, 2022 at midnight GMT to exchange their tokens at the fixed rate, after which it will essentially become a meme token with no governance rights. The vote also confirmed Fei would be assuming Rari\u2019s outstanding liabilities from a hack in 2021. Fei has paid out over $9.6 million to victims of the hack that totaled slightly over $11.6 million. Although snapshot votes passed with few voting dissent (0 RGT against, 3.9k TRIBE against), the team created a ragequit mechanism for TRIBE holders who disagreed with the decision. About 10% of these holders chose to transfer for a fixed amount of FEI (roughly 1.088/TRIBE).\n\nThe merger was motivated by the synergy team\u2019s saw between the two protocols and fairly equal market caps. Fei has a treasure chest of liquidity via PCV, and Rari has Fuse, a platform to create customizable lending pools. FEI was already the largest asset by total value locked in Fuse pools. If their incentives were aligned under one DAO, the team would be able to take the rails of the two projects to build significantly more powerful products. The existing products, FEI stablecoin and Rari Fuse Pools and Vaults, will continue to operate independently while being governed by Tribe DAO. The focus of their new product launches is to find use cases to marry lending markets with a liquidity engine.\n\nFEI Stablecoin Performance\n\nThe protocol\u2019s primary product lagged behind peers in the first quarter in terms of supply growth, volumes, and velocity (the ratio of volume to supply). The V2 implementation and governance updates thereafter helped the stablecoin maintain its peg within the desired band, piggybacking off the DAI peg with a 1:1 redeemability for DAI via the peg stability mechanism. However, in terms of volatility around the peg, FEI\u2019s peg remains wider than the top five stablecoins.\n\nThe supply numbers for FEI include both circulating FEI and protocol-owned FEI. As market volatility increased in December and January, so did DAI and FEI peg stability. This led to increased redemption of FEI for DAI, primarily from arbs. Simultaneously, PCV declined as ETH fell, putting pressure on the reserve ratio. Fei Protocol enacted contractionary monetary policies on January 23 and January 25 by reducing protocol-owned FEI from the market. For the quarter, circulating FEI supply fell 18%, and protocol-owned FEI dropped by 38%. As of March 31, 59% of FEI supply is on DEXs, led by Uniswap and Curve. Under 12% of supply is on lending platforms, with Rari and Aave the largest holders.\n\nPCV Management\n\nFei\u2019s PCV is predominantly ETH as measured by core assets (including stETH and other ETH lending deposits). It\u2019s entering the quarter at about two-thirds concentration in the asset. Almost the entire remainder is in decentralized stablecoins LUSD, DAI, and RAI, with about a 2% balance spread across native lending and exchange tokens like BAL, COMP, AAVE, TOKE, CREAM, etc., and a 1% position in DPI. As the selloff in markets progressed through December and January, Fei saw a substantial amount of FEI redeemed in exchange for DAI, depleting balances from $125.6 million to $44.7 million by the end of the quarter. The team made monetary changes by reducing the supply of FEI to relieve pressure on the peg. Redemptions have since halted, leaving Fei Protocol with a 75% concentration in ETH as a core asset at the close of the first quarter.\n\nThe PCV shrunk in value by 12.3% in Q1. The primary factors were the circulating FEI redemptions for DAI as well as an 11% fall in ETH price, which was largely offset with a 9% increase in ETH held. The second largest increase in PCV was the introduction of gOHM to the PCV after entering into a partnership with OlympusDAO, building a $2.1 million position. The Tribe DAO controls the allocation of the PCV and was active in the quarter. The biggest changes were repurposing ETH from Compound and a second Balancer pair to Aave. Stablecoins were also released from Compound and the Liquity Stability Pool, a yield-generating pool of assets that liquidate LUSD loans, as the protocol replenished the stablecoin balance after the January Dai drain.\n\nTracking the PCV\u2019s yield generation will reveal the efficacy of the DAO to manage the assets in the PCV. Unfortunately, it is difficult to track revenues produced by allocations currently. As the steward of the PCV, the DAO is incentivized to optimally allocate both PCV assets and protocol-owned FEI. This risk/reward balance should directly impact the value of the TRIBE token.\n\nTRIBE token\n\nWith the launch of Fei V2, TRIBE became more than just a governance token. It assumed the buyer-of-last-resort role to backstop FEI as well as benefit from buybacks from earnings on PCV. Most importantly, however, TRIBE is the governance token for Tribe DAO, managing FEI, Rari Capital, and the PCV. There is an initial maximum supply of 1 billion TRIBE, with 453 million circulating at the end of the first quarter. Because the DAO has discretion to allocate rewards to incentivize liquidity, the token's inflation rate will be dynamic going forward. That said, the core team and investors are subject to a 4-year linear vesting and 5-year back-weighted vesting, respectively. The DAO uses the treasury TRIBE holdings as extra rewards to incentivize users to engage with different Fuse Pools as well as other liquidity investments with their PCV or protocol-owned FEI. To increase the alignment of governance and yield for TRIBE holders, the DAO is planning to release xTribe in Q2.\n\nLiquidity-as-a-Service (LaaS)\n\nIn November 2021, Fei Protocol and Ondo Finance launched Liquidity-as-a-Service (LaaS). LaaS is a debt offering that DAO treasuries can use to increase their project\u2019s liquidity. Historically, liquidity mining is at the cost of equity capital for a treasury, as they need to bootstrap two sides of a liquidity pool as well as incentivize others to do so with token rewards, i.e., equity from the treasury. With LaaS, the DAO only needs to fund one side of the liquidity pool, and FEI will loan them a stablecoin for the other side. The cost of the debt is a fixed percentage paid to Fei Protocol (5% in the first iteration) plus the impermanent loss of the pair, less trading fees earned. At the end of the loan, the DAO pays back Fei Protocol the full senior principal position plus interest, keeping the liquidity fees.\n\nThis offering still has its risks. For Fei, if the DAO token they are loaning against goes down more than 50%, the DAO will have to liquidate other treasury assets to pay back the loan in full. Because this is a debt offering, not equity, Fei might need to secure collateral to the junior assets it is loaning against in the event the borrower\u2019s treasury doesn\u2019t have enough assets to repay.\n\nThe first experiment resulted in both profit and risk, as seen by the bear market ensuing shortly after launch.\n\nResults from the first experiment were profitable but also demonstrative of the nuanced risks, revealed by the bear market that ensued shortly after launch. First of all, there was a lot of appetite from DAOs, proving there is demand for this liquidity product. Fei also learned a lesson on how to approach liquidity and debt offerings. Some holes in the first iteration were no liquidation rules nor collateral controls, leaving Fei in the unintentional position of directional trader. In the coming launch of Turbo and other products, the DAO will benefit from this first Liquidity-as-a-Service innovation and will be able to create new guardrails and frameworks for deploying FEI. There are also more opportunities to launch new LaaS markets in a more structured form.\n\nRoadmap\n\nTurbo\n\nLaunched on April 20, Turbo is the first release from the newly formed Tribe DAO of Rari Capital and Fei Protocol. An interest-free stablecoin-lending facility to DAOs, Turbo takes whitelisted DAO treasury assets (native tokens) as collateral in exchange for a zero-interest loan on FEI, as long as the FEI is allocated to a yield-generating strategy. The appeal to DAOs is a liquidity boost to their lending pools.\n\nFor example, if ABC DAO was whitelisted (certain liquidity and historical volatility metrics need to be met) by Tribe DAO for Turbo, then ABC could borrow FEI for zero interest against an equal value of ABC collateral as long as it will add the FEI to a yield generating strategy like a Fuse pool. Adding a stablecoin to a Fuse Pool increases liquidity in the pool in two ways: first, by increasing total size, meaning more can be loaned at a lower utilization rate, and second, by adding an asset that can be borrowed using the treasury asset allocated as collateral. For ABC DAO, ABC tokenholders would be able to lend their assets to the pool and borrow FEI against that collateral. The DAO receives interest and fees on those assets \u2014 a productive use for previously stagnant treasury assets - and Tribe DAO also takes a cut of those fees, adding to its PCV.\n\nFor Tribe DAO, Turbo is a way to monetize its PCV. As discussed earlier, Tribe DAO should seek to manage FEI monetary policy and keep total FEI supplied below the PCV. However, while the reserve ratio mentioned above remains above 1, Tribe DAO can use its ability to mint FEI as a productive use of capital to generate fees, essentially borrowing against its PCV to mint and loan out FEI. This dynamic demonstrates how the liquidity engine of Fei Protocol (i.e., the ability to maintain a stablecoin and attract assets for PCV) paired with the lending platform of Fuse can create productive capital.\n\nxTribe\n\nThe Tribe token continues to evolve along with the Tribe DAO. At inception, TRIBE was the governance token for the Fei Protocol managing the FEI peg and PCV allocations. After the transition to V2, TRIBE became a seigniorage token as well, benefiting from yield in PCV in the form of buybacks while taking on risk as the backstop for FEI.\n\nAs the Fei-Rari partnership grew, Fei voted to increase TRIBE rewards for lending TRIBE into Fuse pools, which only increased post-merger. As a result, over 10% of circulating TRIBE was locked in Fuse Pool 8 (184 million as of March 31, 2022) to optimize rewards, which inhibited those holders from participating in governance. On March 22, Joey introduced xTribe, an ERC-4626-compatible token, to align governance and yield-seeking incentives.\n\nExisting TRIBE locked in Fuse Pool 8 and existing RGT locked in Fuse pool 6 and 7 will be automatically upgraded, while future TRIBE staked in yield-generating strategies can receive xTribe for their TRIBE. The new token will offer auto-compounding for holders, the ability to participate in governance with multi-delegation capabilities, and the ability to be used as collateral in Turbo with the largest revenue share out of any token. xTribe is expecting a code audit this April and then will be waiting on a DAO vote.\n\nAn interesting dynamic will be the rewards direction that is empowered by xTRIBE. Like the Curve Wars model where stakers get to vote on rewards direction, xTRIBE will give stakers a vote that can direct TRIBE rewards in Fuse pools. So if xTRIBE stakers want to direct more TRIBE rewards to any specific pool or asset, they could do so. From a DAO liquidity standpoint, this means users can further incentivize liquidity in their token in the lending pools by directing rewards towards it.  \n\nOther Q1 Proposals and Changes\n\nJanuary 25, 2021 \u2014 Upgrade Dai Redeemability\n\nThe team discussed methods to tighten the peg given its underperformance in terms of volatility around the peg compared to other large DeFi stablecoins. The proposal was to tighten the FEI peg to DAI in the PSM. Coincident to the early January volatility and loss of DAI from the PCV via redemptions, the team decided to also remove mint fees from the DAI PSM in order to incentivize rebuilding DAI balances in the PCV. The tighter peg and incentives have helped reduce volatility around the peg and increase DAI in the PCV.\n\nFebruary 10, 2021 \u2014 Governance Enhancements\n\nNew governance enhancements proposed using Liquid Representative Democracy. According to Joey\u2019s post,\n\n\u201cLiquid Representative Democracy means that a committee is elected by the DAO to operate the Optimistic Timelock with discretion. The DAO can at any time change the composition of the committee by adding or removing signers. This opens up more opportunities for the most committed community members to play an elevated role in governance.\u201d\n\nThe committee will be the Tribe Council, operating a 5-of-9 multisig and made up of community, Fei core, and Rari infrastructure members. No group can individually reach a quorum. To balance the greater powers given to the Council, there will be a 4-day time lock on decisions as well as greater veto powers given to Tribe DAO (1-day time lock), Guardian (immediate execution), and Nope DAO (immediate execution). This is a novel structure using Orca Pods and optimizing for speed in the product suite with protection for the DAO as a whole. The structure will likely require greater transparency on actions and proposals for negative consent from the DAO.\n\nMarch 21, 2021 \u2014 PCV Sentinel\n\nDAO passed a vote to create the PCV Sentinel, giving the ability to create automatic guards to the DAO Guardian wallet. The Guardian wallet can pause or unpause any operations related to the PCV. A guard in the Sentinel is a smart contract capable of pausing PCV operations if a trigger is hit, empowering the team to have automatic fail safes on the PCV to protect assets.\n\nMarch 24, 2021 \u2014 Volt joins the TRIBE\n\nVOLT is a CPI-pegged stablecoin backed by a combination of user-deposited assets and PCV, incubated by Tribe DAO. With this proposal, the Tribe DAO agreed to a token swap, assuming control of 30% of VOLT and a 10 million FEI backstop for VOLT at launch.\u00a0\n\nConclusion\n\nFei Protocol and the emerging Tribe DAO are in a strong position but lacking momentum. FEI usage has declined while other stablecoins are increasing adoption. The PCV is well-backed, the liquidity engine is stable, and the lending platform is running well. New product launches should offer an exciting use case and proof of concept for the combined team. The individuals involved in the project are highly capable and have proven their ability to learn, iterate, and build. Execution and product market fit for the new launches has yet to be proven, but the building blocks are well-made and in place.\n\nThis report was commissioned by Tribe Grants, a member of Protocol Services.

It's official! So yeah, thanks everyone for joining us on this Compound quarterly analyst call. I just want to let everyone know, if you guys have any questions feel free to drop them and we'll try to address those towards the end of the call. Quick introduction, my name is Sean. We have Sami here, and we're both research analysts at Messari. We're here today with Getty Hill from GFX Labs. Very kind of him to be joining us here again today so thank you for that. If you want to just give a brief introduction of who you are, what's GFX Labs about and kind of how you guys fit into the puzzle of Compound.\n\nGetty Hill (00:49): Yeah sure thing, thanks for having me here. I'm glad to be invited back for a second time to go through the numbers here on Compound over the last quarter. So myself and GFX Labs have been involved in Compound now for definitely at least two years, solidly. We're responsible for a lot of the fun governance stuff in the protocol, and one of the general movers and shakers on there as well. Definitely check out the other work that we're doing in general in the space. We have Poppy, which is a neat crypto credit card product that we're developing and the game Etherlands, but we love to dabble in DeFi and governance wholeheartedly as well. So you can see our work on Compound by checking out the forum over there or on Uniswap and whatnot as well. We're in all places for the most part, we really enjoy participating in DeFi and the wild space of crypto.\n\nSean Butterfield (01:41): Awesome, yeah thanks for that overview. So yeah, basically the focus of this call today is really to kind of dig into some on-chain data, get a better understanding of what happened over the quarter and identify any changes in KPIs, some key changes to the protocol, and overall market trends. So, before going into that I just want to give everyone, maybe some new viewers, a quick recap of what Compound is. A leading decentralized interest rate protocol, serving as a marketplace for lenders and borrowers of various assets. Before digging into the macro, I kind of want to give a quick crypto market backdrop. Generally the overall crypto market in Q4 hit all-time highs, which largely drove a lot of the activity in the previous quarter. As we rolled into Q1 we saw some volatility, shaving $1.4 trillion off the peak back in Q4 to around $1.6 trillion in Q1. Revisiting those 12 month lows that we saw back in july of 2021. I think as we understand that a little better it'll kind of help drive and appreciate the narrative of the overall Compound sentiment over the last quarter. It appears leverage increases as the markets experience bull cycles. So, as we mentioned, the market cooled down in Q1, and that's a really good segue into going over some of these macro metrics for Compound. I'm going to share my screen here so bear with me. Are we all good here? Awesome. So yeah, you'll see outstanding loans and deposits are really the driving factors of Compound. As you can see we saw a pretty substantial decrease across all indicators here. We saw about a 42% decrease in outstanding loans. Coming from about $6 billion to about $3.5 billion. Largely driven by the borrower appetite, the demand for leverage decreasing in Q1, and going down. Outstanding deposits dropped about 32% coming from $14 billion to just shy of $10 billion. Originations also took a pretty big hit, just over 50%, going from $11 billion to just under $6 billion. Subsequently, deposits also were down about 80%, a pretty nasty metric there. We saw $63 billion last quarter drop to about $13 billion and change this quarter. Really the only metrics that saw any light were liquidations, but at the same time probably not favorable for most of the users of the protocol. We saw about a 300% increase in liquidations from about $34 million to $134 million. I think that was mostly driven by the wETH markets on Compound. Digging a little deeper into the net interest, income, or the financial I should say. Total interest income was slashed by about 50% from $90 million in Q4 to just under $42 million. As the loan demand decreased, depositor demand decreased which ultimately decreased interest expense from about $80 million to about $37 million giving us just shy of $5 million on that interest income. Q1 there was a pause in the grants program so there weren't any grants paid so we really just have an unchanged net income amount of $4.8 million. Going a little further down we have the token incentives paid. Similarly as the loans outstanding and the deposits outstanding decline, we'll definitely see a decline across the token incentives being paid. So that fell from $55 million to about $26 million over the quarter. Giving us an adjusted net income improvement of about 53%, ending negative $22 million in the quarter. That was a lot of data thrown at you so I hope you were able to digest some of that. I wanted to ask you Getty, if you have any overall broad input on those changes over the quarter?\n\nGetty Hill (07:06): Yeah, I think it definitely wasn't by any means a strong quarter for Compound. I think similar though, it was a tough one in general for many platforms in DeFi so it's not exactly Compound acting as an anomaly in this instance. I think generally speaking some of the key external inputs in the space, there are strong indicators to what the health of the ecosystem has kind of shown over the last quarter or so. Definitely slow, I mean, I noticed the other day that Tether had its last print on April 3rd and in February, late February was the last USDC mint. So things that for the most part in Q4 and certainly in Q3 were just chugging along printing huge amounts of new dollars and value into the space have substantially contracted. So I think those are interesting indicators to say okay, maybe there's some external reason behind the shrinking growth in the platform over the last quarter. I do want to highlight one of the most important line items on this page here is aggregate utilization. After all, the protocol's job is to take in assets that folks lend the protocol, and then lend assets out to borrowers and that's a key stat to me on here. It's a bit hard to say when you see outstanding loans in terms of a dollar value adjusting because there's all these coin prices and whatnot. Aggregate utilization is an important one because of that. So it's disappointing to see that it is down, but when compared to some of those other stats that are showing 41% shrink in outstanding loans, and the 32% shrink in deposits, I think it becomes a lot easier to stomach. When you understand the general bread and butter of the protocol here, sure it shrunk, but it really shrunk by less than 6% over the last quarter and that's that's the key component for me.\n\nSean Butterfield (09:09): Yeah great, thank you for that input. Sami did you have anything?\n\nSami Kassab (09:14): No, I think Getty just made a good point related to how a lot of the decreases aren't a direct relation to specifically Compound, it's mainly related to the general financial market that we're seeing going on in the crypto space. We had general market conditions trading sideways and so a lack of users looking for leverage is essentially going to lead to a lack of borrowing activity. Pretty straightforward here.\n\nSean Butterfield (09:50): Getty, quick question, you know I feel like these metrics are pretty easy to follow, is there anything outside of this that you typically look at and maybe does it change as the overall market sentiment changes? Whether we're in more of a bull cycle or more of a bear cycle, are there different indicators that you're keeping track of?\n\nGetty Hill (10:13): I think there's some specific users that you can look at that demonstrate a good wind vane essentially for the flow funds in the space. If you look at some of these monster accounts, I mean especially if you want to figure out who the big users are on the platform and track what they're doing and say hey, these guys are sophisticated. They're on AAVE, they're on MakerDAO, they're on Compound, they're on all the money markets. They're even on cross-chain platforms. Where are they putting their capital? How is their capital flowing? Those users are the ones I tend to look at when we want to get a bit more of a specific sample as to what's happening. One of the reasons why Compound is what it is today is that there are a lot of users who used it once upon a time, a year ago, two years ago, and just never left. That makes it a little harder to look at the whole picture and get a macro sense of what exists here and what's actually occurring in the trend. If you look at some of those particular target users who have a few hundred million dollar position on Compound but also on AAVE and also on MakerDAO, they paint a better picture of exactly why users are flowing capital from point A to B. Is it because MakerDAO is reducing their interest rates and providing a more capital efficient opportunity for those users? Is it because AAVE is offering some new assets that have a collective better overall margin opportunity for those users? Those are the details that you can't necessarily encompass in a macro overview like this that can paint a bit more of a precise picture.\n\nSean Butterfield (11:48): Yeah I totally agree with that comment, and yeah we might high level touch on something similar to what you're saying as it relates to the more sophisticated deeper liquidity folks who are participating on the platform. So, moving along, Sami, I'll let you take over here. We're going to go over some of the charts as it relates to these outstanding loans and deposits and I'll let you take care of that Sami.\n\nSami Kassab (12:24): I appreciate that. So, starting off here with the outstanding loans. In general we saw outstanding loans declined by roughly 42% like Sean was saying. These levels are going back to what we saw around July of 2021 and again like we discussed, this is mainly related to market conditions trading very choppy for the past quarter. We really haven't seen any new highs like we saw in Q4. Just a lot of volatility up and down which is what you see in a sideways trading market. The biggest contributors that we have to outstanding loans are obviously the stable coins and that's where we saw the biggest decrease. We had DAI which decreased roughly 47% this quarter and USDC decreased roughly 41% this quarter as far as outstanding loans. Now, if we go to the next chart here we can take a look at the borrower interest rates. In general, last quarter these rates were averaging at about 5% in Q4. For this quarter, Q1, we saw rates averaging about 3.8%. A pretty substantial drop in borrower interest rates. One thing I found that was interesting is ever since Q3 you're kind of seeing a minimization of volatility in general for borrower interest rates and that's kind of excluding what we saw in October and November of 2021. We saw the volatility there take up mainly around when the market was peaking as far as the general market cap. One thing I wanted to ask you about Getty, the majority of borrowing demand on Compound we know is originating from people looking for leverage and also people seeking out yield farming opportunities. That's really because DeFi in its state right now is more of a circular economy. It doesn't really feed into too many real world applications. I was curious if you had any views on where you saw future new demand, new borrowing demand, originating from? Do you have any thoughts on that?\n\nGetty Hill (15:01): Yeah, I think in the immediate future there are a number of collateral assets the platform is looking to support and I think those will be the most immediate things to drive our demand. Particularly something that GFX Labs has been working on is getting MATIC added to the platform, Polygon\u2019s native currency. I think there's a huge amount of interest in getting that supported and on somewhere on mainnet because currently it's not actually available to borrow against anywhere on mainnet, in size at least. I think that's on the immediate forefront, and then from there I think the longer term view looks like the industry is still extremely nascent in the whole sense. I don't think necessarily external motives from the traditional world are going to be influencing the platform anytime soon. I do think as we look to expand beyond basic ERC-20\u00a0 tokens as collateral and some more sophisticated positions, new opportunities will rise to the platform. People have been talking about getting stETH added to the platform which has been quite popular. Other versions of staked ETH also, and then from there other derivatives like some of these AMM LP tokens and whatnot that you can safely assign collateral values to. It's a matter of time, and building out the infrastructure for those components, but I think that's what will be drawing borrowers in over the long-term.\n\nSami Kassab (16:18): Yeah, that makes sense. Then when we think longer term as well, once Compound goes multi-chain that'll definitely bring new borrowing activity as well onto the protocol.\n\nGetty Hill (16:31): Yeah absolutely, those new chains will be really important. It\u2019s something that AAVE has done massively well on is succeeding in onboarding new assets on those chains and it\u2019s something we have to play catch up on at this point.\n\nSami Kassab (16:46): Yeah so another question I wanted to bounce your way is related to recursive borrowing. For the viewers here that don't know what that is, can you kind of give an overview of what recursive borrowing is and then also provide your view on whether that has a positive impact on the protocol or if it's more of a negative or frowned upon impact?\n\nGetty Hill (17:10): Sure thing. So there's two particular users on Compound right. There are users who supply capital because they're interested in borrowing some other assets. So they supply one coin and borrow a different coin. Then there are the other users who just supply capital to the protocol in an interest to earn yield. Now within those there's a sub category of users who just traditionally supply whatever given asset to the protocol, and then there are these recursive participants. So some just supply, some put on this bit more sophisticated strategy where you will borrow, or you do this positive collateral. Say DAI for example here, you have 100,000 DAI. Then you can go and borrow up to your maximum whatever the collateral factor is against DAI on the market and borrow the maximum of it. You now take everything you just borrowed, you deposit it back into the protocol, and you repeat this process over and again to get that recursiveness. Essentially, what it does is it amplifies your dollar notional position on the platform while maintaining the same amount of capital that you're invested into the position. Why people do this is because at times we're incentivizing participation in the protocol through COMP rewards. COMP is getting paid to the pro rata share of participants on the supply side and then the pro rata participation on the borrower's side. So users can amplify their pro rata participation in this pool by doing this recursive kind of setup here. I think that's the quick overview of what it is. This has been going on for coming up on two years, you know? But yeah, it's been going on for a long time. There has been some recent debate about how sustainable? How important are these for the platform? What do they actually mean for the platform? All that is happening here from a purely stats standpoint is the user is depositing capital and the interest rates will largely remain unchanged and the utilization of the protocol remains unchanged. Regardless of if this user is a traditional supplier of the protocol and just lending that capital, or recursively borrowing it. The amount of capital getting deposited is the same and it doesn't affect the change in utilization because they're just perfectly looping it through. So, in general the only change in the protocol is changing TVL a little bit, changing interest rates a little bit. It doesn't really provide significant capital to the protocol by any means beyond just a general supply. Essentially these things function identical to what a normal lender would do to the protocol, the only difference is that they're amplifying these stats because there are some other reasons to make the stats bigger. But for the most part they just function like any other loan to the protocol.\n\nSean Butterfield (19:58): Gotcha, so it sounds like it's not adding any additional risk to the protocol and so essentially they're just farming out these COMP rewards. If we ended up seeing in the future at some point these COMP rewards being removed from the market would you essentially see these recursive borrowers leave as well?\n\nGetty Hill (20:22): I don't think they would necessarily leave, but I definitely think there would be a decrease. Essentially what's happening right now is the protocol is subsidizing rates. Just to make up a number, if the protocol is paying out 3% interest rates and the COMP rewards add an additional 25 or 50 bps to the protocol, hey that's 25 or 50 bps. In theory if we pull those out then some capital should drift away from the protocol to better opportunities. But the core premise that folks need to remember is that these guys are looping because they're interested in getting the best interest rate available. Their job is to make money ultimately and so if we decrease our rates further by removing this extra incentive but we remain to be the best option for their capital, their capital will stay. So I don't think we would lose 100%\u00a0 of capital that's relying on these rates because at the same time, the general problem exists at AAVE as well and at any of their alternatives to where they can stick their capital. At this point the rates have been on a solid trend down since the very day they started, but particularly in the last half a year or so. You could look back to even five or six months ago, or at the very beginning of the year. You could still earn 12% doing a recursive loan on DAI which most viewed to be a very safe, stable rate to be earning capital and today it's substantially less than that. I think we've already seen a solid progression of those rewards decreasing and of that participation decreasing along with it.\n\nSami Kassab (21:56): Perfect, I really appreciate you breaking that down. So let's go ahead and move on to the next slide where we'll talk a little bit about outstanding deposits in general. Wrapped Ethereum continues to maintain its dominance, it's the largest deposited asset on the protocol. This quarter we saw DAI and USDC kind of neck and neck competing for that second largest deposit, they're very close as far as actual dollar amounts. The interesting thing is that we saw DAI\u2019s outstanding deposits decreased nearly 50% and then if we look at deposit volume for DAI in the quarter that was down 90%. Sean was actually pretty curious about why this DAI deposit volume had decreased so much, so he worked with one of our data scientists here and they were looking at the on-chain metrics and it was suggesting mainly that there were a few market makers that were basically arbitraging between AAVE and Compound. Like you said, looking for the best interest rates. It seems like they closed out some pretty large positions in Q1 and that goes back to what you were saying in the beginning. Looking at the macro doesn't really tell you the whole story. Looking at some of these whales and some of these users of the protocol also gives you additional insight for what's going on on the protocol. One thing that got me curious as well, last quarter we saw Coinbase\u2019s DeFi yield integration. Essentially, if you had DAI they would pay you an interest rate and they were taking that DAI and then inserting into Compound. Last quarter we saw a large inflow of DAI and it seems that this quarter we saw a 50% reduction so it makes me think did we get a little bump in outstanding deposits from that integration that long-term wasn't really sustainable, it just depleted slowly. It makes me think because the protocol has MakerDAO\u2019s direct deposit module coming up which is essentially going to do something similar. So, I just kind of wanted to get your view on, do you think these integrations with different products have a long-term effect on the protocol? Or is it sometimes short-term?\n\nGetty Hill (24:32): Yeah I think it's tough to say. We don't really have a long history or really any history of protocol integrations materially changing the landscape of what the platform looks like. I'm really excited for the D3M module though, MakerDAO\u2019s direct to buy deposit module, to come about. I think that's a really efficient way for the protocol to get capital and also to symbiotically work with MakerDAO in an uncompetitive environment where everyone wins. So I'm very much looking forward to that. I do think that though it's a bit hard to say what it all looks like. There's a strict balance in my mind as a bit more of a traditional DeFi person, that protocol integrations are great as long as you don't add on too much systemic risk to the space. Because ultimately some of the games that folks are playing with Compound and say well, Compound is in a great position to succeed if AAVE explodes one day, god forbid it ever happens and vice versa. So everyone needs to make sure we also don't stack on too much systemic risk in the space which could lead to the demise if something truly awful were to happen.\n\nSami Kassab (25:40): Moving on to depositor interest rates, in general we saw rates decrease as borrowing demand declined over the last quarter. Q4 we had the average rate for depositing be around 2%, this quarter it\u2019s around 1.5% on average. One thing interesting to note is that we are seeing the normal depositor interest rate, and the depositor interest rate with incentives, start to converge. Not only for depositing, but for borrowers. This is partially attributed to COMP basically halving COMP rewards, and I'm sure we'll talk about that quite a bit in later on, so I'll just kind of mention that for now. But, related to all these new integrations I have another question for you. Do you see the source, the main source of deposits on Compound in the future coming from professional liquidity providers? Whether it's funds, VCs, institutions, is that what the protocol is targeting rather than the normal DeFi user? This might be a general DeFi question, are these protocols starting to focus more on institutions that have more deep liquidity rather than the person who's yield farming in their mom's basement?\n\nGetty Hill (27:19): I think we need to keep in mind when we're talking about depositor rates, we're largely thinking about the stable coins on the protocol. DAI, USDC, Tether, and I think largely speaking, the folks who are leaning on those markets the most, representing the largest portion of those markets, are institutional players or players with extreme high net worths who are looking to park dollars for safe steady rates for a long period of time. I know for certain that some of the larger participants in the borrow/lend ecosystem in crypto, like the BlockFis, the Celsius, or the Nexos of the space, certainly look at general dollar rates. The primary stack historically in crypto for dollar rates has been the funding on the Bitcoin perp. But certainly DeFi dollar rates are creeping into the methodology as well as like hey, how much do my dollars earn and where can I put them? We're slowly developing a bit of our own DeFi based LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate) across all the ecosystems.\n\nSami Kassab (28:23): Yeah that makes sense. Thanks for breaking that down. Last slide I'll be covering right now is going to be the utilization ratio. If we can go to that slide, Sean? This slide basically summarizes what we've been saying. Basically the outstanding borrows have decreased in relation to outstanding deposits. The only interesting thing I can comment about this is that historically we've seen 40% almost serve as sort of a support level and we haven't seen that rate drop below 40% for a significant period of time. But Q1 we have seen it fall below 40% for an extended period of time. I think that pretty much wraps it up here, I'll pass it back to you, Sean, to take over the next few slides.\n\nSean Butterfield (29:35): Cool, thank you. So we kind of touched base on this a little bit earlier in that macro table as it relates to interest income. Obviously as you can see there's a substantial decrease quarter over quarter. I think it was about a 53% decline from $90 million to $42 million in interest. It's directly correlated with the overall demand for loans, repayment on those loans, interest that essentially flows through the protocol. One thing I wanted to mention is looking at the data, it looks like USDC actually led the way in the deterioration and interest income. It accounts for about 62% decline with USDT and wBTC fighting for second in interest income deterioration with 50.8% and 50.7% respectively. Moving on to protocol income, the narrative is very much the same across the board outside of liquidations. Protocol income, same thing, was halved in Q1 a little over 50% and the same thing, USDC led that reduction in income. I'd be curious Getty, I know there have been previous conversations related to improvement in protocol income. How important is it to the overall Compound protocol and community at large? Instead of me talking about some of these points I'd be interested in hearing some high level remarks about what could contribute to the improvement of protocol revenue, and maybe how far we might be away from some of those implementations?\n\nGetty Hill (31:32): Yeah so I think I'll preface it with let's keep in mind Compound\u2019s governance has been around for less than a year and a half at this point so everyone's still learning what\u2019s the best way to organize and everything. That being said, the reserve factor is what determines how much the protocol takes from interest paid by borrowers before it reaches the lenders. That number is a set parameter on every single market on the platform. Generally speaking, stable coins have a much lower one, altcoins have a much higher one. Particularly when we're talking about the big income earners for the protocol we're thinking about DAI, USDC, Tether. Now, USDC and Tether both have a 7% reserve factor which means we get 7% of interest paid from the borrowers there. Whereas DAI notably has 15% which means, I think the thought was this thing's a bit more volatile so we'll take a bit more when it was originally set. That being said, back to my original governance comment here, the protocol hasn't really done much to play around with these or do any type of research really about should we be choosing a higher or lower number and so we have rather limited data to actually say what we should be doing. The protocol needs to get in a spot where we're willing to experiment a bit more with those rates to actually understand how income can be optimized for the protocol and take those revenues to something a bit more sustainable than what we're currently at today. So it's a bit of a complex problem that generally needs a bit more time and testing before we really speak to it. Hopefully that's something we get to start doing here in the near future.\n\nSean Butterfield (33:13): Sure, recently I was scouring the forums and it looks like there's been mention of building out an asset onboarding framework as it relates to why we should onboard a specific asset. I understand demand would be a very critical factor in that but maybe if you can kind of touch base on any input you might have on that and how you think that would move forward?\n\nGetty Hill (31:32): Yeah, that's a bit of a long point so I'll try to keep it brief here so that I don\u2019t brick the rest of the deck here that I know we have. But you know, when it comes to listing assets you really have to think about it in a few different categories, or at least the few different points you need to assess. One is the general interest from folks who would be supplying that as collateral and folks interested in actually borrowing this collateral. One of those two things needs to be substantially true for the protocol to even really assess it. From there it becomes the security risk and understanding that. A lot of the assets that folks are interested in adding to the platform right now, other than MATIC, are FRAX, LUSD and RAI which generally speaking are a bit outside the normal range of where the protocol operates. Especially in part of the complexity and risk spectrum when it comes to asset listings. So it's a delicate balance of we want to add things to the protocol that users are interested in and want, but we don't want to stack on too much protocol risk. Because, not to be dramatic, but if we list an asset and we give it a collateral factor and it has some type of error in it, the classic example is the infamint, then all the funds in the protocol can be drained if that thing has like infinite, you know has any collateral factor greater than zero. So, the protocol tends to be quite conservative with listing new assets especially because when you look at the stats as we are here, wBTC, ETH, DAI, USDC, the protocol would be not too different if we didn't have any of these other assets in the protocol and we wouldn't be going through this spreadsheet if you just imagine we only have those four coins. It would be largely the same stuff to be talking about so you really have to be careful about the marginal improvement by adding a new asset.\n\nSean Butterfield (35:30): Yeah, that's great. Sami, I don't know if you had any questions or input on that?\n\nSami Kassab (35:38): I just think that's a great point that's getting made. It's really just stables that have the majority of borrowing demand and it kind of goes back to the multi-chain approach that is being talked about. Just having one collateral asset or one deposit asset I believe which is just going to be USDC, right? We'll be talking more about that multi-chain approach as we get towards the end of this slide deck.\n\nSean Butterfield (36:09): So yeah, I'll pass it back to you Sami as it relates to liquidations.\n\nSami Kassab (36:15): Yeah, so like you pointed out Sean, in the beginning. Liquidations was one of the only metrics that kind of had a good quarter. We saw a substantial increase in liquidations. Question to toss your way Getty, can you give some thoughts on liquidation revenues importance to the protocol? Do we see this as healthy revenue?\n\nGetty Hill (36:38): I think this is a newer thing, so it's not recent but I think in mid-2021 we changed the liquidation system to split part of the liquidator incentive. So historically there's been about 7% or 8% that was distributed to the liquidator and then the protocol was like we're going to keep three of that for ourselves and we're going to give five of that to the liquidator. Now this is something similar to what MakerDAO does. They get some revenue from liquidations as well as I believe AAVE, but I could be wrong on that one. So you know it's a weird one, my personal opinion is that protocols shouldn't be incentivized to have liquidations. The inverse of that opinion to play devil's advocate quickly, is just simply that well the protocol is taking out risk here you should be similarly compensated for that loan. My opinion is that risk comes in the factor of the interest rate and that reserve factor we were talking about before. But yeah, I think it's a good thing to be experimenting with especially we all have to remember, as I get stuck in the trenches of DeFi quite often, that really we've only been around for two years so there's a lot to be learned and experimented with.\n\nSami Kassab (37:49): Yeah, exactly. So, moving on to the next slide here we're going to have a chart on token incentives paid. I guess this is where we can talk a little bit about some of these governance proposals that have been passed. So, one of the most critical or major governance proposals that we saw passed this quarter was proposal 92, which basically reduced COMP rewards paid out by 50%. This seemed to be a pretty heated discussion as far as in the forums. There seemed to be people on both sides and I guess the plan was to kind of slowly step down to zero rewards. I think proposal 100 aimed to do that but recently, I believe two days ago, we saw proposal 100 fail. So, what is the plan? I know the community has to really talk about this but as of right now we're just kind of sitting at 50% rewards, right? Is there a plan that the community is talking about? Is there a reason why this first proposal went through and now all of a sudden it seems like the community might have changed their mind? Because I believe it was outlined how initially you guys were going to step down to 50% and then eventually to zero. So can you talk a little bit through maybe both sides of the argument related to removing rewards versus keeping them?\n\nGetty Hill (39:39): So, first I want to set the stage a bit and say when we think about rewards and how they're distributed to users of the protocol we need to think about them in token terms and in dollar terms. Now ultimately we're assuming that the folks who are interested in these rewards the most are here for the financial incentives, that these guys are running and interested in money. So ultimately for their experience, all they care about is the dollar notional value of these tokens that are coming to them. From the protocols perspective, we probably care about the dollar notional value of those tokens but we also care about the general number of tokens as we're essentially entering new tokens into the supply, the circulating supply, and diluting all the existing COMP holders. So it's a bit of a difference there that I want to highlight. If we look over the last year or so, certainly in the last eight months, as COMP prices declined with generally the rest of the DeFi ecosystem. Those dollar notional rewards or distributed users have kind of declined itself. From the people who are interested in using the protocol's perspective rewards have already been cut, right? The inverse of that would be for us to maintain a dollar value and increase the notional amount of COMP we're distributing to maintain the actual dollar notional rewards that they're achieving, but that's not the case. So from their perspective, hey these things have already been going down for a while and you know, that's what they're used to and we already have a lot of data to support what those users are going to be doing as those rates decrease across not only Compound, but the blanket of DeFi. Now particularly with the most recent and 92 and 100 proposals, I think everyone is on the same page that these rewards aren't sustainable for the most part. I shouldn't say everyone but there's certainly some agreement around that these aren't sustainable. Things need to be reformed, and I think that's why 92 is a bit more easy to stomach. It was just a general, we're going to cut these in half. It was quite clearly cited in 92 that there was going to be a proposal 100 that was going to cut them to zero. I think folks largely either didn't read that or were just like, all right well we'll deal with that problem when we get to it. So 92 was rather not controversial. For the most part folks kind of just voted and supported it, it seemed pretty straightforward. The folks who I think represent the protocol most, happily understand that it was a good decision. Then 100 ended up being extremely controversial. I mean I haven't gone through the data because there are a hundred proposals at this point to go through, but I think it is the most controversial governance proposal that has occured on Compound, and certainly one of the most controversial ones in DeFi in general. In the sense that we had, for our protocol, very good voter turnout, about half a million on each side and it came down to 7,000 votes. Which really when you go down the list of people who are set up to vote in the protocol it was a pretty good population of folks who actually turned out to vote. There's a number of people who I was disappointed not to see but it was relatively good. Disappointing outcome from my perspective because I really think rewards at this point are doing very little to support the system and largely just hurting existing COMP holders like myself, but you know that's that's the plight of governance.\n\nSami Kassab (42:55): Yeah, I think it's really interesting how basically depending on how you interact with the protocol leads to how you would view this decision, right? So if you're a big whale that would be using this protocol, obviously it's not in your incentives to want some of these rewards to be removed. But, if you are a VC, or a contributor, or just simply a holder, it's in your best interest to have these rewards eventually go to zero. Because you're not getting crowded out anymore, you're not getting devalued essentially. So it's really interesting to see everybody in the community put their opinion in like you said. I mean the forum post was just popping with everybody, I think it was the one i've seen with the most comments. Like you said, that 7,000 vote delta was extremely close. Anything to add to that, Sean?\n\nSean Butterfield (44:03): Not a whole lot, but as an observer, I'm not a participant of the protocol, it makes a lot of sense from a sustainability point of view. Plenty of mercenary capital that's soaking up all the rewards, dumping the tokens, applying sell side pressure on the COMP token price. It makes sense that this isn't sustainable long-term and making those steps, strategic steps, to try to keep everyone on the same page, keep everyone happy, but also maintain the health of the protocol. Definitely in agreement with the conversation there.\n\nGetty Hill (44:44): I'll add a quick tidbit there, so while this proposal was going on, I was doing some quick research to figure out how many of these COMP rewards are roughly going to folks who are just immediately selling the token. What are these recursive participants doing? Because generally those are the folks who are doing it, and what are they immediately doing et cetera. If you just look at the top 10 suppliers of USDC to the protocol, the top 10 suppliers of DAI to the protocol, and you only look at those accounts. DAI and USDC alone account for over 77% of total COMP rewards distributed in the program. So largely those two alone account for pretty much everything. Then from there you can look at these users and see what their activity is and what they're doing. You're going to count right there between all of them that they represent these recursive users who are just here simply with mercenary capital, which is fine, I'm totally fine with that. They get the COMP, and then just immediately sell the COMP. That accounts for about 41% of the COMP rewards getting distributed and that's just the sample of the top 10 users on those two markets alone. I was trying to get some quick data in like 30 minutes together and that's what I quickly found. I was like well if it's 41% with just this set, the number is definitely a fair bit higher. All we're getting out of this is a little more capital in the protocol and a higher TVL number and you know, for what? To continue diluting all the existing holders and accepting kind of mediocrity on this program. To me it's a pretty black and white issue that I did not expect to be so controversial in proposal 100.\n\nSean Butterfield (46:29): Yeah, you bring up a lot of good points and it's not that we don't want participants on Compound but we also need to kind of create a healthy floor and stabilize the overall protocol so kind of shaking out some of the mercenary capital by removing some of those incentives makes sense.\n\nGetty Hill (46:51): Yeah I mean we have a great user base. You guys have the data here to show that there is billions of dollars of regular, natural usage of the protocol. Folks who are supplying ETH and wrapped Bitcoin, and borrowing dollars for the core example of leverage on their assets. This program that we have here to distribute incentives, best case is adding like $1.5 billion, really best case is adding $1.5 billion. Most likely it\u2019s adding somewhere between about $650 million, $800 million to the protocol. It's not significant to the actual day-to-day operations of the protocol or fundamentally changing anything about the protocol. It's really just in my mind a leach on the protocol at this point. Compound existed well before the COMP incentives ever existed and proved that it had a natural use case in the market, and the data still supports that it does today. So can we get rid of this thing already please?\n\nSean Butterfield (47:50): That makes a lot of sense. As I said, as an observer just looking at it really from a data perspective, hearing input from the community and yourself. Overall, you just want an attractive protocol that's sustainable, that's healthy, that promotes growth, and encourages users. So it\u2019s a step in the right direction and I'll be curious to see how the next proposal that might try to bring the emissions down to zero will go. As we move forward, we touched on deposit volume a little bit. An 80% decline over the quarter, from $63 million to $13 million in deposits. DAI accounted for a lot of that and as Sami was mentioning, me and another couple folks were digging into some on-chain data and it looks like it's exclusive to a few market makers that were really trying to arbitrage between AAVE and Compound early or sometime in Q4. Not only is it super cool to see the on-chain data to kind of make those suggestions but it's also interesting to see that's really what drove a lot of quarterly deposit volume. Then also as we enter Q1 it looks like maybe a separate market maker was basically redeeming their funds from the protocol. Maybe in preparation for the reduction of COMP emissions towards the end of Q1. So yeah, really interesting to see as you look at the chart, it's a pretty glaring drop in quarterly volume. As we kind of wrap up here, at least as relates to charts, originations, same story. Demand for loans declined. The demand for new loans will follow. So seeing a 53% drop from $11 billion to $5 billion. What I thought was interesting is four consecutive quarters of the declining originations. I think that's largely related to the overall market sentiment but we might be curious if you have any kind of input or future outlook of originations moving forward.\n\nGetty Hill (50:25): You know, stats like volume and originations are a bit hard to nail down. Just because it's DeFi, capital is just extremely liquid. If folks want to leave and join the protocol for an instant they are welcome to do so with no penalty. So that makes these stats kind of hard to focus on and that goes back to the very first slide. The thing to really care about is that utilization number. So for me that's the number I focus on. Less so the originations and volume stats.\n\nSean Butterfield (50:56): That makes perfect sense to me. I mean like you said, you could easily throw a billion in and take a billion out inside of a day and it still contributes to originations or deposit volume on a quarterly basis. So that makes a lot of sense. So yeah, moving on into governance. It looks like there's about eight proposals that were passed in the quarter. I won't touch base on all of them, but I'd say there were a few that were pretty critical changes to the protocol. Sami, did you want to take a stab at those?\n\nSami Kassab (51:37): Yeah, so we talked about two of the really important ones, proposal 92 and proposal 100. I guess one of the other ones I found interesting was proposal 89 and that was reducing the proposal threshold from 65k COMP to 25k COMP. Which I think is important to stimulate further activity into the governance system. One thing I thought that was interesting was that we really didn't see that many voters on proposal 100, even though it might have been one of the more popular propositions or governance proposals. I think there were a total of 48 addresses. So Getty personally, have you seen that trying to get people to contribute to some of these governance proposals has been difficult?\n\nGetty Hill (52:37): You know, it's not so much the number for me as it is the amount of COMP that shows up to vote. These systems aren't democracies you know, we run on a plutocracy system here where it's based off of capital rather than who's present. So for me, it's what\u2019s the COMP turn out in these things? The COMP turnout was decent, it was pretty on par with the other significant proposals that we've had historically. It certainly could have been higher, I would have liked to see a number of folks turn out that didn't turn out. But I think for the most part it wasn't disappointing as a specific proposal. In general it'd be nice to see that we had a larger percentage of the COMP turnout to vote. As you know we're 6 million circulating supply, 6.5 million circulating supply. To only have a million turnout isn't terrible, but it isn't great either. It'd be nice to have two million turnout for these things as far as the number of voters goes. If you just check out on the Compound website there's great databases for this stuff. Really, once you get around to voter 50 as far as the leaderboard goes, the amount of votes really substantially drops off. A lot of these things are largely decided amongst the top 25 people, just because that's where the power is really contained as far as the number of votes, and who possesses those votes.\n\nSami Kassab (54:01): Yeah, any thoughts on potentially, I don't know if any protocols actually do this, but incentivizing people to contribute to, or just to vote in general?\n\nGetty Hill (54:16): I don't think that active voting is really important. That's kind of the weird part of this. So there should be more things to vote on in general. I think that's important, that's one of the reasons why I like the idea of 89 and that there's about three facets of making proposals right now. You either have enough votes delegated to you that you can make the proposal, or you either have the COMP yourself, and you know the total number of coins. Or you're on the white list. Essentially a thing that the community multisig in governance controls is the whitelist addresses with proposal power. The whitelist is neat but that's largely a social mechanism and so the first two are still the most critical ones for the protocol. You cannot call yourself a true DeFi protocol that has governance unless you have completely on-chain control of all the code and all the contracts that make up that system and make it accessible for anyone to come and change something about that system without asking anyone else for permission. That is to me, the core tenant here. So lowering the proposal threshold from 65 thousand to 25 thousand materially doesn't change the risk of the system, the quorum, the number of votes required to actually get a proposal to succeed, is remaining the same. Folks could actually argue to raise that number as well but the system should be more accessible to a larger populace to make those proposals. Not everyone is as fortunate as me. While I have a large percentage of my net worth in Compound, I don't actually have the 75 thousand votes that we have on the platform. We're lucky enough to have some folks who have those tokens that are willing to delegate to us since we pay a lot of attention to the protocol.\n\nSami Kassab (55:58): Gotcha, yes, proposal 89 really just increased decentralization and inclusivity of the protocol. So for the sake of time, I guess we'll speed through this next slide here just on grants. Is there a date yet related to when the new grant program will be back?\n\nGetty Hill (56:20): No, I mean I think it's a matter of a personnel problem. Essentially you just need someone to come in and run it. That person, if someone's listening here, listening to this recording is interested in trying to run a grants program for a protocol and might have some experience applicable to it. Do come to the forum, write a forum post, make your argument that you should do it. You can get paid quite handsomely to do this, this is by no means a side gig. Uniswap employs a team for their grants program and so do other protocols, and they all get paid quite handsomely. So I think it's really just a personal problem at this point. Everyone's for it but no one has the time or the bandwidth for the compensation that's being discussed.\n\nSean Butterfield (57:00): Yeah, just a couple last points as it relates to the road map a little bit. If you could maybe share some details on where we're at as it relates to the multi-chain strategy and then lastly, I know there are some limited details as well around Compound 3, but maybe if you could share what you can, what you know, and your general outlook on both of those.\n\nGetty Hill (57:30): Yeah, absolutely. So, I don't have any proprietary information. I'll say that first, I'm just for all intents and purposes, a community member and I know for a fact that really largely all the VCs are in the same boat. The Labs team, who's the core engineers behind the protocol, does a very good job of not telling anyone anything. So what we do know is really just the public information. So they've done two developer calls in recent times where they have discussed Compound 3 with folks. Generally it's a much slimmed down version of the protocol. Instead of the generalized money market right now where folks can deposit and borrow anything on either end, you're supplying a thing as collateral and you're only borrowing USDC or whatever that reserve asset is. So the first version as they've told everyone is going to be with USDC as the reserve asset. In theory that reserve asset could be anything else, which makes the system a bit interesting. You could have a bunch of little versions of Compound 3 like little silos where you could have one that's flavored to ETH where you're depositing a bunch of ETH derivatives and only borrowing ETH as the reserve. You could be depositing a bunch of Bitcoin derivatives and buying only wrapped Bitcoin as the reserve. All sorts of fun things could be done with this and I think that's kind of where they're going with it. A bit more of a gas efficient, simpler protocol to swallow and just generally more efficient. Like all the original smart contracts at this point are well over I think two years, and so that's the other main component here. Making it easier to deploy and run on the other chains. So frankly though we don't have tons of information as far as timeline goes in development, we know what they've stated is that there is the plan to post the open source version of the protocol in late April. So maybe this week, maybe next week, I'm not holding my breath. Maybe a couple weeks after that and then we'll get a testnet version of it the following month. The code is going to go to audit to Open Zeppelin and Open Zeppelin is the formal audit partner of the protocol so I think they're putting on the finishes with that and it's going to be going to Open Zeppelin here in the next few weeks, so I've heard through the grapevine. Then we'll kind of go from there. I mean, I think everyone's kind of hoping for a mainnet launch in July or something, or June. But everyone keep a massive grain of salt with everything I said because this is coming through about like 30 minutes worth of two different conversations, and everything is subject to change and I don't know anything really in reality. So, we'll see what comes. I think everyone's excited.\n\nSean Butterfield (01:00:06): Yeah, that sounds great. I was able to catch some of those calls and it does sound like the testnet is supposed to kick off shortly so I'm sure everyone's pretty excited about that. Real quick, it seems like the development's been a little different as it relates to the multi-chain strategy. I know the initial idea was to kind of go with that Starport integration and it seems like there were some development hiccups. As the landscape developed over DeFi and multi-chain strategies compromised platforms. It sounds like they were kind of trying to pivot to a different model? Are you able to maybe touch on that a little bit?\n\nGetty Hill (01:00:50): Yeah, I don't know much. I think the general idea was let's make the code simple and let's make it easy to deploy and easy to manage. There have been hints at additional tools to help manage all these different employments and some new testing tools throughout these protocols. It's been discussed that the new oracle solution that the protocol is going to go with is just going to be directly Chainlink. Which is advantageous for all the different chain deployments where there isn't necessarily robust on-chain liquidity that exists on Ethereum. But I mean largely we don't know. Again there's a lot of guessing work going on right now so I think we'll find out in the next few weeks here a lot more information. Then you even still have the product the next couple of months and it should be a fun summer.\n\nSean Butterfield (01:01:39): Yeah, sounds good, something to look forward to. I don't know if Sami, if you had any other questions on our end? You know we're pretty much rounding the hour here so I think the questions from the community have been submitted and I think we've kind of touched base on that. If any other viewers have any questions please feel free to throw them down, otherwise it's been a good time. I've really enjoyed having you and hearing all your insight.\n\nGetty Hill (01:02:24): For folks who are interested in following along with Compound in general there's the forum at compound.xyz. There's the governance action forum on Compound Finance, you can check out the proposals that exist there. Join the Discord as well. There's a developer call that exists every Wednesday in the morning, well every other Wednesday. Then on the other Wednesdays that aren't the Compound lab developer call I tend to run a community call on Twitter that's a bit more casual than the formal developer call. In general for folks who are interested in following GFX Labs and our interesting governance on Uniswap, MakerDAO, and Compound, and the other awesome products that we're developing over here. Which is in fact, what really I spend most of my time on, believe it or not. Do check out GFX Labs and Poppy Finance and Etherlands, all the rest of our main projects.\n\nSean Butterfield (01:03:04): Awesome, well thanks again. Sami, thanks for joining as well. I hope everyone has a beautiful weekend and we'll do this again next time.\n\nSami Kassab (01:03:13): Yeah this was fun, thanks everyone!\n\nGetty Hill (01:03:15): Thanks for having me, cheers!", "references": [{"name": "Sean Butterfield", "url": ""}], "published_at": "2022-04-23T14:49:00Z", "author": {"name": "Sean Butterfield"}, "tags": ["Quarterly-Reports", "Decentralized-Finance"], "url": "https://messari.io/article/state-of-compound-q1-2022-analyst-call-transcript"}, {"id": "967e89f1-9075-418b-8afe-698687cb2ffa", "title": "State of Avalanche Q1 2022 Analyst Call Transcript", "content": "If you would like to view the full recording of the live Crowdcast event, you can find it on our YouTube channel. You can also read the full Quarterly Report by James Trautman here.\n\nParticipants:\n\nJames Trautman - Messari research analyst\nJohn Nahas - Ava Labs\nEd Chang - Ava Labs\nLuigi DeMeo - Ava Labs\nNick Mussallem - Ava Labs\n\nJim Trautman (0:06): Okay, I think we're live. We're gonna get a check. Good thumbs up, good to go. All right. Perfect, all right. So good to see some of you again. Nick and John, we've had a chance to meet once before. Luigi, welcome. I\u2019m going to just kind of set the stage for why we are here in case we have some new folks joining us for the first time. Really, the purpose for us being here is that Messari has been working on quarterly reporting, similar to what we see in a traditional world especially in traditional finance when evaluating companies and these sorts of things but at the same time very very different. You know, it's like there's nothing traditional about what we're doing here, especially when it comes to reporting. The point is that capturing events and capturing data in different time series allows us to evaluate you know really how things are going whether that be through certain data, certain trends or simply you know strategies that any endeavor is putting into place and that could be companies involved, it can be enterprises utilizing the technology, as well as the community itself driving it forward. Really that's why we are here and we are revisiting now the first quarter of 2022. Subsequent to having covered the last quarter for 2021, which was a pivotal quarter for Avalanche. A lot is going on, so the first quarter of this year is no exception. It's the same story, we're not going to boil everything in an hour. There's a lot to cover so hopefully we cover everything. We're going to try to have a conversation that if it's the first time to this call or your first time kind of looking into what the Avalanche ecosystem is and what's going on, we want to be able to provide some insight there all the way down to really, really deep into the community and hopefully we can provide some insight at a deeper level so you know that's why we're here. Today we're really going to talk about you guys, introductions, a high overview of what we're seeing over the first quarter, and that involves the network at a high level of what's going on with the network. Specifically, forms of usage, daily transactions, and these sorts of things. That's more quantitative and then it's sort of trying to tie that then to the actual ecosystem and sort of bringing it back to more qualitative manners that fundamentally we can start to think about the value that's actually coming to this space. It's easy to look at price, market cap, and be like \u201coh it's valuable\u201d and see this data but, what we're trying to do is really flesh out what's the driver. What's fundamentally happening here that's driving everything and what are the efforts that everyone that's involved, and how is that driving. That's ultimately why we're here. I'm a research analyst with Messari and have the honor to cover the Avalanche network and ecosystem and cover it on a quarterly basis. So that's about me but from there let's just start with a quick introduction of who you guys are, who Ava Labs is, what is Avalanche for those that are just completely unfamiliar, and your relationship with the Avalanche network.\n\n  \nJohn Nahas (4:34): Nick, you want to kick it off with introducing yourself, and then I'll go.\n\n  \nNick Mussallem (4:40): Sure. James thanks for having us back. Nick Mussallem, I'm the head of product at Ava Labs and so my teams are really focused on the road mapping strategy, product strategy, and competitive analysis, and then we have a project management team that leads the execution of those. We have a very talented design team that takes that strategy and makes it visual and considers the user experience. And then we also have a product analytics team that really kind of tells us how we're doing once we take things out to market. That's a summary of me and our teams.\n\n  \nJohn Nahas (5:17): John Nahas, Vice President, Co-Head of BD, I oversee the BD team at Ava Labs covering five verticals: DeFi, GameFi, culture, and social. So NTF\u2019s,\u00a0 institutional capital markets, as well as exchanges and wallets. We've got Luigi here from the DeFi team and on GameFi so I\u2019ll let Luigi introduce himself.\n\n  \nLuigi DeMeo (5:43): Thanks, John. Hey guys, Luigi DeMeo head of DeFi here at Ava Labs. I apologize in advance for the video and audio quality, but I span across BD and the strategy of all of our labs for DeFi and help grow this ecosystem as much as possible.\n\n  \nJohn Nahas (6:08): Can we get Ed in here?\n\n  \nJim Trautman (6:10): I'd say not yet. We'll dive into that a little bit more.\u00a0 We'll let Ed in when we can. We're limited to the number of folks that we can have on the call so we'll have to bring people in as we get into the deeper dives into specific topics. So I guess pretty quickly to any of you, what is it and what is Avalanche. We've discussed this before, but again for anybody that's new, what is it and what is Ava Labs\u2019 relationship to it?\n\n  \nJohn Nahas (6:45): Absolutely. So Ava Labs, where we all work, is the firm that created the Avalanche blockchain. Now Avalanche is an open-source, Layer One blockchain so Ava Labs is a service provider to the Avalanche Foundation. We help with BD, with marketing and development on the protocol level, as well as a lot of other work that we do with enterprises and partners. Avalanche, as most of you know, is a new Layer One blockchain launched in September of 2020. Avalanche utilizes a novel new consensus which is the Avalanche consensus which allows us to achieve speed, high throughput, and the entirety of the network is actually very eco-friendly. Based on a recent expert study, the entirety of the Avalanche blockchain utilizes 46 U.S. households worth of carbon which is really low in the proof-of-stake family relative to some others in our group and infinitely more green than the proof-of-work chains of course. Avalanche is a multi-chain architecture. We have an X-Chain where you're able to create, mint, and burn assets with limited business logic. We have a P-Chain where validation delegation occurs, but also the ability to create permissioned or permissionless chains, what we call subnets, which I'm sure we're going to dive into a little bit later. And then of course our C-Chain which is our EVM compatible smart contract chain. That's where a majority of the action that you see in DeFi and NFT\u2019s is occurring so think of us as an L1, but in some capacities, you can even think of us as a Layer Zero allowing for a true Web3 economy to grow and to see the transfer value continue.\n\n  \nJim Trautman (8:25): Great sense. Okay, thank you for the introduction. Let's kind of just move into why we're here and really set down Q1 of this year. So I'm going to share my screen. Hopefully, we might see all of us for a moment. Just let me know when you see this sort of report in front of you. Good on that?\n\n  \nNick Mussallem (9:08): Yeah, we can see it.\n\n  \nJim Trautman (9:25): Okay great. All right, so as I mentioned we are now more or less tracking in a 90-day interval the development and progression of the Avalanche ecosystem, the Avalanche network. Sort of very quickly revisiting the fourth quarter of 2021 because while we can always just look at a snapshot of the last three months or the quarter, there's always a relationship to the prior quarter that we need to bring into the discussion and one thing that we'd asked last quarter because it was an explosive quarter at the end of the day and all given fronts of every metric that you can evaluate and every partnership and everything that was going on in terms of any given growth strategy, we asked why. Some things are not in this report and John you had mentioned the importance and we spoke about it at length last quarter about one of the things that is important to anyone that will engage with the Avalanche ecosystem is the eco-friendly carbon footprint that the blockchain leaves. In this quarter there was actually more data that came out about that and it's not in this report because it's not easily tied to the data that we're evaluating. I just wanted to call that out and then it is a big reason for folks to want to use this particular platform. That said, there were many partnerships executed and things that were basically in the works as we headed into the first quarter of 2022, and the narrative really that I took away from this first quarter is that there was continued growth. What I\u2019m kind of showing here right now, and we'll step away from this is what the report is all about and I just want to share with the audience what we're trying to do is give any reader key takeaways of the quarter and provide data, provide some background on Avalanche itself and ultimately tie it back to anything qualitatively going on. So just a preview of the report itself. Let's see, let's focus more so on the data that's within the report itself. We want to make sure you all can see this. That the state of Avalanche Q1 2022, is it visible to you all?\n\n  \nNick Mussallem (12:28): Yeah, James we can see we're on the Avalanche key metrics summary page.\n\n  \nJim Trautman (12:31): Perfect, okay. So as I mentioned we did see continued growth and in the report, I refer to it I think in one spot as modest growth, but that's really compared to the fourth quarter when you see network usage and network financial metrics growing at 500% or 600% and so on and so forth and I think in some cases into the thousands of percentage points. In Q1 we saw continued growth, but not like we saw in Q4, but calling out that it's still growth. What stood out to me was continued growth in active daily addresses. So just regular interaction with the network. We saw a 33%\u00a0 increase in that metric as well as daily transactions. One of the other ones that stands out to me again is we knew we saw a 72% increase in revenue and from an evaluation point of view, that actually put downward pressure on what we call the price-to-sales ratio which suggests, you know, it's not perfectly vetted from the financial perspective on the complete meaningful point that this metric has, but relatively when you look at it across the space there is some insight from it. And what we're leading to is again, there's always a question as to why. Here's the Avalanche address group and of course, we see over the fourth quarter amazing growth and then we get into the New Year and it was actually in January that we saw an all-time high of active address growth and there was a statistic in there that the first week of January actually consisted of more activity than all of October, but since then we've sort of stabilized. So that's the other narrative. A lot of times what we see in other networks is a lot of growth, and then it subsides. It reverses course and it's volatile. And while there's some volatility here, we're still seeing some stability in that. Well, actually, I shouldn't say some, but quite a bit of stability in activity. Similarly, it's the same with daily transactions. We're seeing an upward trend there and we have plotted here against that transaction fees. So I wanted to kind of start with that. As we think about why the continued growth in activity, daily transactions, and also interestingly enough what's going on with these transactions? So I'll come back to that but, in my findings, and you guys can speak to this, but as we crossed over into the New Year there was the really the launch, the unleashing of the custom EVM subnets. I think that's part of what we were seeing here. Also, I had seen some releases of Apricot. But first, if I may ask, what is the importance of the EVM subnet? And there was a JSON file that was also released that I believe made it very easy for folks to develop and create their own EVM custom subnet. Can you explain a little bit about that shift and what that means?\n\n  \nJohn Nahas (16:33): James, I'll turn this over to Nick and then to Luigi to add on to the subnet, but real quick just want to recap some of the important things that you highlighted. We've seen sustainable and consistent growth to your point. There's usually a burst and then it tapers off. We've seen the doubling of transactions, we've seen continued usage, we've seen continued growth with new applications continuing to grow, new innovation on the chain, new projects, new teams building. So that initial kick that we got from Q4 has really continued into Q1 and I know we're going to discuss a lot of the things that we have coming that came about in Q1 that are really going to propel us in Q2, but I think it's a really important metric, to highlight that there's a consistent and sustainable growth in users and transactions and in partnerships across the board. But to your point on the EVM subnets, Nick, do you want to jump in?\n\n  \nNick Mussallem (17:34): Sure. So we're at a very exciting time where we start to see GameFi really start to explode on-chain and with the advent of any kind of high transaction high throughput application you're going to need to be able to horizontally scale, and subnets of course are our horizontal scaling solution. It's been a very exciting quarter as we've launched DeFi Kingdoms onto that subnet. So as we start to do this we're starting to tackle a lot of the questions around subnets are they're ready to be used. You can deploy them very easily. There's a ton of documentation on them but there's a whole satellite of utilities that need to be there in order to properly support subnets which is while we're moving into the development of Core and which is our wallet experience which is going to have support for all subnets which we'll be launching very soon as well as explorer support.\u00a0 Each and every subnet needs to have its own explorer. So we're building out the mechanism to launch these subnets. But when you launch them, you also need to launch the utilities rim which also includes things like API\u2019s and our endpoints that are needed to successfully run them. So that's what we're seeing around subnets. We've got the baseline technology there and we're starting to see rapid usage of it in very innovative ways so we keep making it smoother and easier for the builders and also for the users to access them and engage with them and really leverage other kinds of utilities to get the most out of them. That's the focus in Q1 and then going into Q2 as well.\n\n  \nJohn Nahas (19:20): Luigi, do you want to touch upon the importance of EVM subnets of course in regards to DeFi and everything else?\n\n  \nLuigi DeMeo (19:23): Yeah, I'd be happy to. So I think Nick touched on it well. Subnet EVM allows you to deploy a subnet in one line of code. It's an EVM-based subnet so what this allows is it allows applications to deploy on the Avalanche C-Chain where a lot of our activity sits. Once they get to a certain level of activity and require more transactions and throughput, they can easily divert into their own subnet once they build the community and kind of naturally horizontally scale the network. What that does is two things: it allows the transactions on the main chain or the C-Chain to go down and fees go down, but it also allows overall network throughput to go up. This is just a way of horizontal scaling. Just to touch on the address chart a little bit just to give a little context, I think it's important to look at those numbers from a relative perspective. Crypto in general topped at the end of November and since then we've sort of seen it across the board, whether it be Bitcoin, Ethereum, alt chains, Coinbase earnings across the board, we've sort of seen a stagnation since that time period. What's important for Avalanche is Avalanche was able to experience explosive growth and usage and retain all that usage during this time period. I think that's the key. People came for new incentives, especially as it relates to Avalanche Rush and DeFi and they stayed and I think that's the important component to think about from that standpoint.\n\n  \nJim Trautman (20:59): Yeah definitely. That's again one of my takes, and by the way as an analyst with Messari, I'm really not in the community. I'm not as far down as everybody else probably is when it comes to the Avalanche ecosystem. My job is simply to look at data, try to understand it, look at trends, see what's going on there and let it drive the discussion. The takeaway primitive where Q1 was again, continued growth and what I am referring to as stability and I see it as a potential foundation for the next potential wave of growth whether that comes through NFT\u2019s, DeFi, GameFi, enterprise or commercial uses. We'll see, but that was my takeaway so I echo your sentiment about that stability. One of the things I wanted to talk about a little bit more was vertical scaling but we probably don't have time to go that far into that topic in particular. But really quickly, I do want to revisit what we see here in the past in a lot of volatility with the daily transactions on average up until the point where there was a release of Apricot. After that point, that was right here, what we saw is I think an actual impact from that release and I think that's very interesting to see. I would call this period of time very stable compared to what we saw in the past. Especially at a time when daily transactions on average are going up. A couple of statistics about daily transactions by the way; on average Avalanche is approaching about 74% of Ethereum's daily transactions on average. There were times when it reached about 90% or more, roughly a little bit more than what Ethereum was processing on any given day. Meanwhile, transaction fees are stabilizing. There is still a little bit of an uptrend that's moving in tandem with network users and transactions. This is all happening now at the same time as subnets are rolling out.\u00a0 So should we expect to see daily transaction fees continue to stabilize and even if anything, reverse course as more subnets are launched?\n\n  \nNick Mussallem (23:53): Yeah, so James I can jump in there. Absolutely. I think what you're seeing a lot in the increase of transactions has a lot to do with GameFi and just the nature of the bulk of what comes through there. The kind of horizontal scaling work that's done as a part of Apricot in the five phases really focuses on those things, which is how do we take the original mainnet launch and how do we make it faster? How do we reduce the fees? How do we make it more stable? How do we improve liveness? That's the focus and we'll continue to focus on that, but as we start to see other projects that come in and say need their own subnet because they want to have specific functionality that maybe is around lower fees higher throughput and they're starting to use things like pre-compiles that are specific to gaming. That will allow them to achieve these things very easily and when those games start to move into the subnets you'll start to see congestion on the mainnet drop and then you'll start to see fees drop. In summary, the continued focus on Apricot in the horizontal scaling of the mainnet implementation plus the advent and the maturity of subnets will have both of those effects. Faster transactions, lowering fees, and also providing scaling solutions.\n\n  \nJohn Nahas (25:24): I think it's important to add on to Nick's point. As you mentioned, fees have gone down. They are ticking a little bit up as usage ticks up but I think Avalanche as a platform prioritizes safety and liveness above any and all things. So in this respect, we are taking a very conservative approach. We would rather have a little bit higher fees, but have the network continue to run without any interruption, without any downtime, without any issues, because ultimately that's the goal. You need to be on 24/7/365 to keep up with this existing market. If we were to be a little too aggressive, we could end up having some issues as we've seen across the board with others and that's just not the attitude or the stance that we would like to take. We'd rather be on the cautious side, on the conservative side, and work to bring down the transaction fees gradually to a comfortable spot that doesn't affect network usage.\n\n  \nJim Trautman (26:40): Yeah that makes perfect sense. And look, I think with any of these networks there are always these trade-offs and there's a responsible way of rolling them out that doesn't just happen overnight. So there's a strategy to make it work with a long-term vision. That's what we're going to track again and that's why we're doing what we're doing. We're going to be able to, next quarter, continue on with this trend and see with the number of subnets that launch, how much activity from each, and what sort of impact that has. But at the end of the day, we still know that vertical scaling and horizontal scaling is underway and what we're seeing now is more of a stable trend.\n\nAnd then, of course, a strategy is in place, so I found this very interesting. I found this chart and data very interesting. Now, really quickly, I do want to dive into what it means in terms of revenue. Some folks out there are concerned if the transaction fees go down, then that means there's less revenue to the protocol. But I don't think that's necessarily true. I think that's a bit to be determined, but I do call in this analysis there's clearly a relationship between the value of the network versus the revenue. So if daily revenue were to go down as a result of subnets, and there is a relationship that holds the value of it in the short term, I'm concerned that the value of the network is going to go down. But the benefits of the subnet, correct me if I'm wrong, are of course in addition to being able to scale and thinking about it long-term it opens up not only use cases, but it will allow for the ecosystem to expand in other ways that will drive additional value. One of those other pieces that I think about is the infrastructure itself. Every subnet will participate in validating the network so I would expect that while transactions need to go down or stabilize, however that will look, we're going to see an expansion of the network itself. The number of validators going up the distribution of stake, further moving it, and being more diversified. Is that is that fair to say in question one? Then question two is if that is fair to say, what does that mean about the value of the network in your opinion?\n\n  \nNick Mussallem (29:36): Sure so John why don't I kick this off and then you can. So I think strategically we don't feel like we want the cost of using the network to have to go up in order to drive underlying chain revenue or the value. So our goal is always going to be to make the chain affordable. As we make the chain affordable we also want to be able to scale it. These are the hard parts, right? How do you scale horizontally? How do we achieve that? We're achieving that with subnets. So we really will just keep scaling the network horizontally, providing the necessary utilities for builders to get to market affordably and quickly, and easily. With things like explorers, wallets, RPC endpoints, and interoperability between subnets to subnets, and subnets to mainnets, and subnets to other chains. So if we feel that we can provide all of that value in an easy-to-use package then we're going to be giving the users what they really want which is a very affordable chain that also scales.\n\n  \nJim Trautman (30:48): Got it. Okay well, I think we got into that enough. It's an important trend that we're seeing. It's an interesting thing. There's a lot of chatter in the world in and outside of the community. Of course, other communities that will point these sorts of things out and have concerns but it's not if you just take a step back. Think about it, to determine what is actually happening here, it's really interesting, in my opinion on that front, so and I think everything that you said right there makes sense on the direction of usage and where its value will come from and its ability to scale.\n\n  \nNick Mussallem (31:40): James, I'll just throw real quickly there that every validator that validates subnets has to be validated. The kind of magic number is no less than five. Each validator has to stake a box right and we didn't want to have to enforce that every subnet use AVAX as its native token because that's taking flexibility away from the builder which would have been an obvious choice in order to increase the usage of the underlying token. But we think that there's a bunch of other kinds of network means from having subnets that will increase the utilization of AVAX and the underlying tokens that are launched on these subnets and so that is a whole growth system.\n\n  \nJim Trautman (32:22): Yeah for sure and I think part of that will show up in the development and decentralization aspect as an overview in our reports as well. So it'll all be tied together and be really interesting to see. We'll probably talk about it more next. Okay, thank you for that. That's kind of like getting into the network overview aspect of what we're looking at quarterly. We could spend the entire hour discussing all of these things and going even further but since time's ticking, I do want to move into the ecosystem itself and developer activities. Then I think from here we'll end up diving a little bit further into DeFi and GameFi and we'll bring our GameFi folks on to the call. But really quickly, I just want to point out that over the course of Q1, we did see a pretty significant increase in core developer activity. I suspect that it has everything to do with everything that we just talked about including EVM custom subnets and as well. I think some new incentives are in play here. And two of those incentives will be referred to as the Multiverse Fund or Multiverse Incentive Program and the Culture Catalyst Program. Can you guys sort of just give a high level of what each of those programs really represents and what you're going after there and sort of the outcome that we've seen so far?\u00a0 Any partnerships that have come out of those programs and where there's some traction?\n\n  \nJohn Nahas (34:27): Absolutely, so I think as we remember from Q4, Rush is really what started a lot of the push for us to grow. That was a DeFi incentive program. We've now moved on to both the Multiverse Incentive Program which is about $290 million worth of incentives to support the growth and expansion of subnets as well as a Culture Catalyst, which is a $100 million to support artists and creators of build or grow their fan base and launch assets on Avalanche. A key caveat here to keep in mind, something that Avalanche focuses on, or that we focus on, is incentivizing the user. A lot of people give out grants. A lot of people do a lot of things. Our core belief, and the way we look at growing adoption, is we want the best teams to come and deploy their products and projects on us. We want people to build on us, and if they do so we'll incentivize the user to come and try it. And then those incentives start to wean off as we've seen with Rush. So that brought DeFi to the fore. Multiverses is focused on increasing the growth of subnets. So that's either incentives for users to come and try a specific subnet as we've seen with DeFi Kingdoms which is doing about a quarter-million transactions a day right now. We're also building out an institutional subnet for DeFi. You might have seen some of the participants there. Jump, Wintermute Golden Tree Asset Management, Valkyrie Securities, amongst many others that are also coming into that group. What the point there is that we're going to really look to provide TradFi players who want to work in DeFi with a regulated kind of permission chain where they can do the things they would do in DeFi, but with trusted and KYC counterparties. If you're a financial institution you cannot be providing liquidity to a market or borrowing when you don't know who the other counterparty is or if that other person could be from a sanctioned country or on a no-fly list or anything of that nature. Now, in a permission DeFi subnet, you don't know who the counterparty is, but you know that all the parties in there have gone through the necessary checks so whether it's institutional DeFi, whether it's enterprise, whether it's GameFi, the multiverse is there to help support these people by either giving them incentives to stand up their own validators so that they can run their own subnet and that's in the form of AVAX. We'll give them some AVAX and get that back once they're set up on their feet. We'll do incentives like we did with DeFi Kingdoms to get users in there. So that's really the crux of multiverse, to really expand the usage and allow builders to really come and not have that overhead to launch a subnet. We'll help them out initially until they get up on their feet with that and then we'll get back what we need and let them kind of grow on their own. On the Culture Catalyst, I'd love to get Ed to jump in on this as well. What we're really doing is spurring creators and artists. So we've partnered with a great team at Op3n that's O-p-3-n, so it's an app that's akin to a Spotify for artists, creators, and musicians to really have a fan base. NFT\u2019s that are more than just art but that link to communities that have fan access and engagement and I'll let Ed talk about the first one. The first project there that we announced at our summit in Barcelona and give kind of a high level as what we see coming down the pipe there.\n\n  \nEd Chang (38:08): Yeah thanks, John. So like John said, we've set aside a co-funding opportunity for up to $100 million for this program.\u00a0 It\u2019s called the Culture Catalyst. We are working with Op3n and they have the pulse on all things entertainment so you know the direct line to musicians, and you know film producers and IP and influencers. So everything we're going to be doing is really about jump-starting that NFT community on Avalanche and really fostering the growth there and bringing in more of a retail audience as well. The first project that we had announced at Summit is with Grimes the singer, the producer, and the director. She's actually, now with the birth of her second kid, looking to put together kind of an NFT children's book based around crypto. There's going to be a music video around that. Kind of a new song she's launching that'll be the first one that we announce. There are a few other really exciting ones in the pipeline geared around the film and music industries that we're really excited about. Think about NFT\u2019s as membership NFT\u2019s as your calling card to deeper access with some of these artists and apparel and other things that it unlocks. So we're really excited about what we're doing there.\n\n  \nJohn Nahas (39:22):Ed while once you jump in a little bit and talk about just multiverses and its impact on GameFi the growth that we've seen in GameFi this quarter because I think that's really really stuck out the most.\n\n  \nEd Chang (39:33): Yeah, so you know my core focus here has been on the GameFi side and we've seen a lot of growth over the last two quarters. We've gone from this narrative of a lot of these casual-like, idle games built, moving forward into more core double a triple a experiences we've announced partnerships with a lot of these really new games. Here, looking at the launch of subnets, the first two subnets that are going to be launching. DeFi Kingdoms already launched and we've got Crabada really close behind them following with the launch of battle mode. So, when we look at the pipeline of the different games out there, it's looking really healthy in terms of the games that we've announced and that are in development right now. As well as some of the games that are kind of stealth right now that are waiting to be announced in this quarter and the latter half of this year.\n\n  \nJim Trautman (40:32): Yeah, that makes sense. And again I think we can see that impacting all the activity as again, we started with this discussion around some developments and DeFi Kingdoms. We knew that was coming and that it went live right at the end of the quarter. There's more to say about it, but in the window of Q1, it was right at the end. I think it was the day or two before, and we actually did start to see data rolling in through various explorers as it relates to DeFi Kingdoms. So yeah, that'll be, I think, a hot topic for the next quarter. The other one is Crabada. Is that how you say it correctly?\n\n  \nEd Chang (41:16): Yeah, Crabada, nailed it.\n\n  \nJim Trautman (41:18): And again, DeFi Kingdoms is part of the multiverse program at this point. Obviously, there's going to be some incentive there to continue to develop a little bit. Can you just give us a real high level of what it is Crababada and this is generating a lot of activity on a test net right now. Can you just kind of give us a high level or is that where we bring in our expert on Crabada?\n\n  \nEd Chang (41:55): Yeah, so Crabada is one of the early games in the ecosystem. At any given moment they're taking between 15-40 percent of the gas on the c-chain. People love the crabs. It's effectively like an idle game that you need three of these crab NFT\u2019s to play. They are moving towards more of an Axi-type battle mode game and they've got other things planned on their road map that they've teased out. People are always running looting missions and mining missions and getting tokens from that and there's this whole economy and community built around that. So this is kind of their core game that they're launching their subnet on called the Swimmer Network. The vision here, the reason they're not calling it the Crabada subnet, is because they're looking to be more of a publisher of games. So they're going to be launching their idle game there, they're going to be launching their battle mode game and then they're looking to potentially bring on other titles who are looking to be on the subnet to capitalize on that community. So you can see where the economics get really interesting. Where they have an inflationary token called TUS, similar to Axi\u2019s SLP but it drives more value. And now they have another mechanism that they can burn a lot of that TUS and they can also take some of that and go reward their validators. And if more and more games are using that in their marketplace for their games, there's that additive value being driven to the token and the network itself.\n\n  \nJim Trautman (43:25): Makes sense. I was able to dig up some initial data on the Crabada subnets again, seeing it very quickly grow so collectively as we see more and more of this occur, we'll try to tie it back to the growth strategy that's in place as well as translates into the activity and the data that we're collecting along the way. I think DeFi Kingdoms and Crabada are examples and I know it's impossible for us to exactly pinpoint what is driving every aspect of the activity, but when you start to sort of timeline things and time stamp and look at how the network is reacting to it, I think it's pretty clear that that there is an impact from the rollout of subnets and really the introduction of GameFi into the Avalanche ecosystem. So anything else on the DeFi front? We're already 10 minutes to the hour so?\n\n  \nJohn Nahas (44:32) I'll just add Luigi's been having connection issues. But, I'll just add on the DeFi front, I think what you really saw, and this was part of our ambition and our goal that we set for ourselves in Q4 and that really played out in Q1, was that you know, with Rush, we brought blue-chip DeFi protocols on like Aave, Curve, Sushi etc. That gave people comfort coming to use it and then we saw existing native Avalanche applications grow. We saw new Avalanche native applications grow, but what we saw really in Q1 is really the launch of new novel projects on Avalanche that previously didn't exist or were tried to be built somewhere else. We saw some teams that were native to Ethereum such as Alpha Labs launch their Alpha X product on us first. The speed of the chain, and the lower cost made it easier for people within other communities to develop applications that have been launched on Avalanche and for the developer community within Avalanche to grow whether it be Platypus, which was just a single-sided stable swap. We recently had Yeti launch. We've seen the Platypus wars akin to the Curve wars. Now we're starting to see the Joe wars akin to that as well so we're really starting to see a native community of builders and developers grow build projects on Avalanche to continue that growth in DeFi, in terms of development and new contracts. So you know all the metrics that matter have definitely been trending in the right way so we are really excited to see the community continue to grow, and to innovate as the network grows.\n\n  \nJim Trautman (46:23): Yeah for sure. A few quick bits that I gathered on the DeFi front is that Platypus Finance is the fastest growing DeFi protocol over the quarter. There was what is referred to as the long tail, so the number of protocols that have a million or more in TVL, stabilized. So kind of look at that as a greater distribution of TVL so I think that's a sign of health in the DeFi space. You know of course Rush has a little bit to do with that and you know all sorts of things that also then translates into developer activities so we saw a greater number of growth in contracts deployed over the quarter and that's all tied into that. We'd love to dive a little bit further into that and try to boil the ocean inside of an hour here. But let's just take a few quick minutes to like one or two high-level events that stand out to you. To me the Summit stands out to me. I was there and didn't have a chance to meet you all but gathered a lot of information. I guess a few of the top-of-mind sort of partnerships or efforts that you guys are working on. Maybe it's\u00a0 Grimes or maybe these other things and again I'm talking about a minute because I want to leave the time for some questions, as well as what's ahead. I could mention Core, we know that that's on the way, and user experience is on the way. So yeah, putting it on you to like two minutes more or less, what's exciting to you as of recent developments in terms of continued development, and what's ahead, what can we expect, if you can, whatever you can show?\n\n  \nJohn Nahas (48:15): So I\u2019ll kick this off and then I\u2019ll turn over to Nick to talk on the product side. I think instead of two I\u2019m going to give you three things. I think one, what you saw was a continued growth on the BD side of the infrastructure level and that kind of the pipes and the roads that helped to build out an ecosystem so you saw USDT launch after USDC\u00a0 launched natively at the end of Q4, but you've seen both of those start to grow. You've seen an expansion in exchanges whether it be FTX or others. You've seen exchanges now on onboard USDC and USDT native to Avalanche. All these things, custody,\u00a0 staking, and wallets, just continue to grow so we're reaching more people. The pipeline in and out of the network is getting easier. Fiat on-and-off ramps and everything there. So that really is the foundational layer that's been growing that allows the builders to come in for the users to try the network and to grow from there. I think the second thing of course is the Culture Catalyst and Multiverse to really drive continued growth with subnets across GameFi, DeFi, enterprise. I think you saw with enterprise last quarter I know he touched on Deloitte, but of course, Ava labs is a partner with Mastercard Star Path program and working with them to kind of put together some pretty cool POC\u2019s hopefully in the future as well as Lemonade right an Insurtech insurance provider to work and create a proof-of-concept Parametric Insurance Program that can be rolled out globally to those that are underserved in the insurance markets but hopefully one day can lead to the inclusion of smart contracts from blockchain technology into traditional insurance. That's the second thing and I think the third thing to culminate the quarter was truly the Summit. I think it was more a culmination of several years worth of work for us to arrive at that point. It was fantastic to see so many people. I'm pretty sure we could have had a lot more but we're really looking forward to continuing that trend. That was our first Summit, our first inaugural Avalanche event and I think it was a great illustration of the diversity of this community whether it be builders, partners, investors, friends, and everything across the board. I think what you're gonna see this coming quarter is really the multiverse expand, the growth of subnets and Culture Catalyst really take a leading role going from there. I'll turn it over to Nick to talk on the product part.\n\n  \nNick Mussallem (50:45): Sure. I'll be real quick because I know we want to take some questions. So I think we've talked about scaling and that's a huge priority for us. We're attacking that with subnets and then the second goal is to really make crypto on Avalanche more accessible to everybody. How do we leverage this great technology and that solution is in Core. So Core is really this curated Web3 operating system that allows users to really access the best parts of crypto in a way that they can understand everything's native to Avalanche itself so you're not having to know how to add custom tokens or deal with smart contracts directly. It's really designed to really give people a comfortable experience to be able to interact with the chain and then two other things is the Bridge, so the addition of Bitcoin support to the Bridge so the ability to natively bridge bitcoin across. You'll be able to do that through the Core extension so we'll have bridging embedded into the extension itself to make it as easy as possible. And then finally make it easier for the builders to get to market and that really is expanding our partnership with AWS and starting to look to ways to deploy and manage blockchain and specifically manage subnets.\n\n  \nJim Trautman (51:59): Perfect, thank you. I know we're speeding up here in terms of all the concepts and discussions to get into, so really quick I'm going to wrap it up in like 30 seconds to try to field a couple of questions and we'll move on. Again, continued growth, and stabilization of the network across metrics and across the ecosystem. We saw the EVM custom subnets kind of roll out things that we didn't mention partnerships with other protocols like Terra partnerships with enterprises, Wildlife Studios, DeFi Kingdoms launching Crabada launching, a lot going on so you know I guess for the folks that aren't terribly familiar here, take a look at the quarterly report to get more detail you know as well as all the resources that are out there available to the community. All right, so quickly going to try and take at least one question if I can figure out exactly where they are.\n\n  \nJohn Nahas (53:08): Yeah, let's grab some questions.\n\n  \nJim Trautman (53:28): How about that? I'm still sharing, aren't I? Here we go. Let me squeeze into that. We might go a minute or two over. All right, let's see. \u201cI think Terra is one of the main competitors for Avalanche. How does Avax plan to compete with Terra and especially its stable coin? Does Avalanche plan to release its own stablecoin?\u201d\n\n  \nJohn Nahas (54:04): Can you repeat it one more time James? You cut out for me in the beginning.\n\n  \nJim Trautman (54:06): Sorry about that. So I just mentioned Terra. \u201cI think Terra is one of the main competitors for Avalanche. How does Avax plan to compete with Terra and especially its Avalanche plan to release its own stablecoin?\u201d\n\n  \nJohn Nahas (54:25): So that's actually a great question for the simple reason that you know there's a narrative out there that L1\u2019s or the other L1\u2019s have to be competitors and we don't see Terra as a competitor. We're all in this to grow this pie in this industry and this entire ecosystem together. That's why we partnered with Terra. We partnered with Terra as you might have seen in the news, and AVAX is going to be backing UST through that purchase. Luigi can jump in and get some more color on that partnership but we don't have any plans on launching a stable coin. Why would we when there's a great one out there that we can partner with and help solidify? So Luigi, do you want to jump in and talk a little bit about that?\n\n  \nLuigi DeMeo (55:00): Yeah sure. Sorry for the issues again from before, but yeah I mean we obviously had this very large announcement with respect to Terra and you know Terra's main goal is at least for my conversations with Do [Kwon] and that team is to grow UST adoption. Terra is a zone of Cosmos that is the chain that they do and LUNA is the staking token of that zone which helps secure the network. So that inherently drives some value to that token which helps to secure it for the stablecoin. From our standpoint, we have one of the most robust DeFi ecosystems out there which is obviously attractive for a decentralized stablecoin. So the partnership really makes sense from both sides. The DeFi ecosystem that needs a decentralized stablecoin and then the decentralized coin that wants to be integrated within a very robust and diverse DeFi ecosystem which Avalanche has at this point. So I think it's just a natural fit from that lens.\n\n  \nJim Trautman (56:04): Makes sense. I mean you mentioned last quarter John that you know it's really not about competition. I think even in my report I called out a competitive analysis that's more of a traditional way of evaluating this. It's more of like a peer group, everybody has their own place and it's all about driving things forward and of course a lot of the credit goes back to Ethereum and the Ethereum community. So, we are out of time. I wish that we could ask more questions but I know that you guys are super busy and I want to be respectful of that so next time I will be a better moderator and try to leave a little time in the end for questions and of course, I would say to you all and the community and all the audience I\u2019m wide open to feedback on any metrics that aren't in this report. Anything that you would like to see, questions that you would like you to know, we're wide open to that and we'd love to continue evaluating and just continue evaluating and continue the conversation going forward. So with that, thank you all. Thanks, everybody for joining. Thank you team for joining us. It's always a pleasure chatting with you guys. So that's where I'll leave it. If you have any last words, you have another event that you'd like to invite us to, let us know.\n\n  \nJohn Nahas (57:40): I did wrap up the last broadcast by inviting everyone to the Summit so I wish we had another summit coming up right away or else I would. But we actually will be doing a pretty big activation in July around the Formula E race in New York. It'll be in Brooklyn. We are New York-based. We're Brooklyn-based, so we will be doing some really cool activations around that date so stay tuned for an Avalanche House in July in New York. Hope to see you all there. Thanks, James.\n\n  \nJim Trautman (58:07): Awesome. Thank you, guys. Take care\n\n  \nNick Mussallem (58:09): Great.
