While it\u2019s appealing to own a piece of a protocol via its tokens, sending tokens is often cumbersome and error-prone. Take, for instance, sending tokens to the wrong address or the constant juggling between user interfaces and wallets. \n\nFIO protocol is a viable solution to improve usability without compromising on decentralization \u2014 it offers a homogeneous user experience when transacting value across various blockchains and products. FIO uses human-readable wallet names to send, receive, and request digital assets.\n\nFIO offers three core functionalities to improve usability: (1) handles, (2) requests, and (3) data.\n\nFirst, FIO Crypto Handles are like email addresses for digital assets. Danielle@messari is a human-readable wallet name consisting of a username (Danielle) and a domain (@messari). Both usernames and domains are NFTs that substitute long public blockchain addresses. This reduces the risk of common mistakes such as sending tokens to the wrong address.\n\nSecond, FIO Requests are like https requests, but they are designed to preserve self-sovereignty. The request function allows users to request payments from other users, e-commerce order carts, or invoices. The prerequisite for this function is that both the sender and the receiver are utilizing FIO-enabled wallets. In terms of usability, FIO Requests are similar to using Paypal or Venmo.\n\nThird, FIO Data is metadata that can accompany any blockchain transaction using a FIO-enabled application. For instance, FIO Data enables requesting or sending invoice payments with cross-chain metadata that specifies what the invoice is for. The metadata is useful, for instance, when including an order cart or when referencing off-chain data. Other uses of metadata include full auditability and adding transaction details for legal and compliance requirements.\n\nBesides the three functionalities above, FIO offers an additional level of verifiability when protecting digital property. NFTs on any blockchain may be mapped to FIO Crypto Handles and FIO Domains. In this sense, FIO supports human-readable signatures as verification for digital property of NFTs created on any blockchain.\n\nTechnology in a Nutshell\n\nFIO is a standalone decentralized usability layer that can be integrated by any crypto product. The FIO Protocol is open and permissionless: be it wallets, exchanges, or payment processors, none of them require any permission to integrate with FIO.\n\nThe Guts of FIO Crypto Handles and Domains\n\nFIO Crypto Handles and Domains are nested NFTs: for instance, the natalie@pocket Crypto Handle has a different private key than the @pocket domain. Like an email domain, a FIO Domain may be public or private. For example, anyone can register a public gmail.com address because Google has made it open to do so. Similarly, a FIO Domain can be set to open status on the FIO blockchain by the private key holder, which would allow any FIO Protocol user to register a username on the @pocket FIO Domain (e.g., natalie@pocket). A closed FIO Domain would be similar to a domain like messari.io because only Messari can give permission for email addresses to be created with that domain. Private FIO Domain owners must sign a transaction on the FIO blockchain to approve the registration of a FIO Crypto Handle thereon.  \n\nAll of a user\u2019s wallet addresses can be mapped to a single Crypto Handle. Whether Natalie is transacting on Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche, etc., the FIO Crypto Handle natalie@pocket will do the job. Mapping involves signing a transaction on the FIO blockchain that links a public wallet key to a natalie@pocket Crypto Handle. This process is entirely non-custodial, as the FIO Protocol does not know the associated private keys. The mapping process is similar for addresses, NFTs, and even, in the future, fiat bank accounts.\n\nTransactions and Requests\n\nOnce a public key has been mapped to a Crypto Handle, any FIO-enabled transaction feels like sending an email. Users can ignore the underlying mechanisms and complex public addresses, because, from their point of view, they are just sending tokens from one party to another. Through this level of usability, the FIO Protocol enables users to transact on-chain within their favorite crypto product as easily as making a Venmo or PayPal transaction.\n\nFIO request functionality has an additional layer of logic that uses Diffie\u2013Hellman encryption to create a shared secret between a requester and requestee. The requester signs a transaction with encrypted metadata specifying the token amount, the Crypto Handle that will send the funds, and any associated data (e.g., a note, invoice, or order cart). The requestee\u2019s FIO-enabled product queries the FIO blockchain searching for requests. Following an in-app notification, the request is decrypted using their FIO private key. At this point, the user may choose to decline or accept the request. Should they accept an incoming transfer request, the transaction is made directly on the blockchain of choice from within the wallet. This transaction is entirely independent \u2014 as the FIO Protocol does not have access to user private keys.\n\nNetwork Usage and Economic Value\n\nFIO has seen a steady inflow of new Crypto Handle registrations ever since its launch in March 2020. More than two years later, on May 1, 2022, there were a total of over 704,000 FIO Crypto Handle registrations, out of which over 459,000 are presently active.\n\nThere has generally been an upward trend in the number of daily transactions leveraging the FIO Protocol, and several activity spikes following new integrations by wallets and exchanges.\n\nNext, let\u2019s assess FIO\u2019s potential market opportunity. In an ideal scenario, the FIO Protocol will be used as the standard usability layer for transacting digital assets. Unlike many Web2 applications that generate revenue solely from transaction fees, FIO uses annual charges on custom FIO Domains as well as prepaid bundles of transactions when registering FIO Crypto Handles. Below we depict a scenario for deriving the FIO economic value based on adoption assumptions.\n\nAccording to Metcalfe\u2019s law, the FIO network value can be considered to be proportional to the square of the number of active FIO Crypto Handles. The underlying assumption is that the number of transactions and their volumes will grow on par with the square of the number of active FIO Crypto Handles. Outside of Metcalfe\u2019s law, future enhancements to the FIO Protocol may open the door to more utility fees in return for additional user value.\n\nFIO Token and Its Tokenomics\n\nThe FIO community launched the FIO Protocol blockchain and token in April 2020. The FIO token is designed as an incentive for key network participants that integrate its features into their applications and as a reward for contributing to network consensus, staking, and governance.\n\nFIO Protocol Fees\n\nEach transaction within the FIO ecosystem has an associated fee in FIO tokens. To make for a smooth user experience, the majority of transaction types are covered upfront upon registering a FIO Crypto Handle. In return, users receive a set number of transactions per year that they can freely use without spending additional tokens. Additionally, the integrator (wallet or exchange) may select to cover the cost of registering Handles and their included bundled transactions on behalf of users. FIO has 21 active and 21 standby block producers (BPs). The 42 BPs set protocol fees and vote on protocol changes.\n\nGovernance\n\nAnyone may become a BP, but in order to produce blocks (as one of the 21 active validators) or set fees and earn rewards (as a standby validator), BPs must earn a top spot by voting power. Blocks are produced in rounds of 126. At the beginning of each round, 21 BPs are eligible to enter the active validator set, providing ample opportunity for BPs to become active should a new BP with significant ties to major stakeholders decide to contribute to network consensus. Ultimately, BPs are responsible for modifying system contracts and enacting protocol changes. A minimum of 15 BPs (i.e., greater than two thirds of the active validator set) must approve a proposal in order for it to pass.\n\nThe Foundation for Interwallet Operability (FIO) is allocated 5% of the protocol fees for running a DAO to coordinate protocol development activities with independent developers and contributors. The majority of entities participating in the DAO are wallets and exchanges that have joined the FIO consortium on a voluntary basis. In doing so, these entities participate in the governance process by signaling their support for the development of new protocol features, before being brought to a block producer vote.\n\nVoting Mechanism\n\nTo participate in FIO governance is to vote for network BPs. A FIO Crypto Handle is required, and tokenholders may either vote for block producers directly or delegate their voting power (number of tokens held in wallet) to active vote proxies. If a wallet or exchange wishes to participate as a network proxy, they act as the default governance proxy for the FIO tokens held in their users\u2019 wallets. Prominent FIO stakeholders can use this mechanism to contribute to network decision-making. \n\nFIO Improvement Proposals (FIPs) are publicly available for review on GitHub prior to BP vote. Feature proposals funded by the foundation require both review and consent to be prioritized on the roadmap. Considering that the protocol is open-source, self-funded FIPs may also be brought forth to BP vote at community member discretion.\n\nFIO Staking and Rewards\n\nFIO token staking went live in January 2022 and is available in partner wallets for users that have voted (or proxied) towards at least one BP. If a user stakes from a registered integrated wallet, the organization receives 11% of stakers\u2019 rewards. Staking rewards may be redeemed upon request while the original staked amount has a 7-day cool-down period.\n\nFIO\u2019s fee mechanism rewards stakers with 25% of the protocol fees, while BPs earn 60%. Aside from BPs and stakers, 5% is reserved for the foundation, and 10% is distributed to integration partners. If there aren\u2019t enough protocol fees to reward participants, FIO is drawn from reserves to subsidize BPs and stakers. A total of 20 million FIO (2% of the total token supply) is set aside in the BP reserve. If less than 50,000 FIO is collected in fees for BPs in a 24-hour period, tokens from the reserve will be supplemented to hit this cap until the reserve has been diminished. Similarly, 2.5% of the total token supply (25 million FIO) is set aside in the Staking Reward Reserve to ensure that staking rewards amount to 25,000 FIO per day amongst stakers, until this reserve is exhausted. Thanks to FIO\u2019s incentive mechanism and decentralized business model, the benefits are spread to all ecosystem participants.\n\nSource: FIO Protocol\n\nSupply Curve\n\nThe FIO token was launched independently of funding. A total of 50,000,000 FIO tokens were initially set aside and were subsequently allocated to the foundation. The token supply has a maximum of 1,000,000,000 FIO: 648,746,346 (65%) tokens were minted at Mainnet launch and 341,253,654 (34%) tokens are being minted over time. The foundation\u2019s allocation (9% of the total token supply) will be fully unlocked by December 2022. Although locked foundation tokens were not programmatically restricted from voting for BPs, the foundation has abstained from voting at the time of writing. The remaining tokens are set to be released linearly through 2033 as depicted below.\n\nFIO Ecosystem\n\nIntegration and Listing Agreements\n\nSince Q1 2020, 64 projects have joined or are in the process of joining the FIO ecosystem. Notably, 58 of these are FIO integrations into crypto products, while the remaining 13 are FIO listings for trading. The FIO rewards and incentive scheme is designed to encourage more projects to integrate FIO into their product offerings. The goal is for FIO-integrated products to have a substantial voice in governance, considering FIO is a usability protocol built for cryptoapplication providers.\n\nCrypto applications such as wallets, exchanges, staking platforms, and crypto payment processors that integrate with the FIO Protocol are entitled to a number of rewards over and above fee distributions and staking rewards. A pool of 125 million FIO (12.5% of the total token supply) is allocated for rewarding integrators. Integrators receive an additional 40% on top of fees for facilitating the registration of new Crypto Handles and Domains. These rewards will be distributed until this reserve is exhausted.\n\nThe foundation also subsidizes fees for registering Crypto Handles and Domains on behalf of an integrated product\u2019s users. Based on the number of users, the foundation awards wallets and exchanges with grants from $10,000\u2013500,000. FIO occasionally airdrops tokens for wallets with a large number of users. As a result, the number of integrations has grown steadily over the past 2 years, and 21 integrations are in the pipeline.\n\nPotential Development Roadmap\n\nCode development proposals are discussed, voted upon, and executed by the FIO community of developers. A summary of current and potential developments is graphically depicted below.\n\nThe current focus is on initiatives that simplify integration and help increase FIO adoption. On the wallet and exchange integration side, the top priority is the enhancements to the integration of software development kits. In terms of user experience and increased user adoption, a further simplification of the send feature is top of the list. In the long run, fiat account resolution and integrations appear to be important milestones toward large-scale adoption.\n\nFIO Competition and Main Challenges\n\nWhile the wallet naming space is relatively crowded, FIO\u2019s main value proposition stems from improved user experience and its ease of integration with other crypto products. When compared to established players such as Ethereum Name Service and Unstoppable Domains, FIO distinguishes itself by being more than just a wallet naming service. In addition to wallet naming, it offers payment request functionality, encrypted payment data, and NFT signatures. That being said, emerging players such as Request Network are starting to offer payment request functionalities. While Request Network is currently limited to Ethereum, Polygon, Celo, Fantom, and NEAR, it is expected to expand its list of supported blockchains. However, FIO clearly differentiates itself through its modular design: FIO was built to be interoperable with any blockchain.\n\nMoving forward, FIO needs to overcome several key challenges.\n\nFirst, FIO must offer a smoother integration experience to increase the number of integrations with existing wallets and exchanges. Currently, partner developers need ~240 hours to integrate FIO\u2019s full suite of functionalities. Recent efforts on developing a FIO Dashboard and a FIO Send API are set to significantly reduce partner integration work time to less than 20 hours. As more wallets and exchanges join the FIO ecosystem and best practices are established, the integration process will become more streamlined.\n\nSecond, FIO adoption is dependent on increasing usage frequency. FIO adoption could be jump started by creating behavioral hooks driven by habit-forming features, coupled with the continued adoption of DeFi.\n\nThird, as the space inevitably becomes more crowded, it will be important for FIO to cement its core value proposition to differentiate itself from other providers. That being said, the foundation has expressed a willingness to work collaboratively with a leading domain space competitor should one emerge. Its goal in this cooperation is to promote the seamless operation of FIO Crypto Handles in a decentralized domain namespace system, subject to block producer approval. If accomplished, FIO would position itself as the standard usability layer for transacting digital assets in the long term.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn a multichain world, users need an easy way to send and receive assets across blockchains. FIO aims to enable a homogeneous user experience that rivals Web2 usage without compromising on decentralization. It simplifies the sending, receiving, and requesting of digital assets. As of May 1, 2022, there were over 704,000 FIO Crypto Handles registered from over 58 partner integrations. The real test for FIO is to grow enough to achieve wide-scale community adoption as crypto becomes mainstream.\n\nThis report was commissioned by FIO, a member of Protocol Services.

The LME, owned by Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing, retroactively reversed these trades because China\u2019s Tsingshan Holding Group faced billions of dollars in losses.\n\nThis fiasco was effectively an advertisement for the Vega Protocol, a decentralized network for margined financial products. As a sovereign blockchain designed specifically for trading derivatives, Vega has developed novel approaches to fairness, risk monitoring and capital efficiency, while mirroring a centralized experience with its high performance. Also, beyond just preventing an event like the LME nickel debacle, Vega is tearing down the high barriers in traditional finance and much of crypto to enable permissionless, customizable market creation.\n\nCredible neutrality, risk management and open access are crucial for the $600 trillion (notional value) derivatives market. Although commonly written off as an outlet for financial speculation, derivatives play a vital role in economic growth and development. The 145-year-old London Metals Exchange, for example, is the largest derivatives market for base metals and helps metal producers and users mitigate the cash-flow volatility tied to price risk. In order for these important markets to remain useful and liquid, they must be functional and fair.\n\nVega Protocol founder Barney Mannerings, a computer scientist with 15 years of capital markets experience, saw the blockchain\u2019s role in building a better, more open financial system early on. But, having designed multiple releases of the London Stock Exchange\u2019s core trading system and matching engine, he didn\u2019t consider Ethereum\u2019s performance and other on-chain properties to be suitable for complex, high-performance trading. However, in early 2018, he realized he could build a well-functioning, decentralized trading network from scratch.\n\nNetwork Architecture\n\nToday, Vega is a standalone, custom-built, proof-of-stake blockchain that runs on the Tendermint consensus mechanism. Vega\u2019s network architecture is optimized for trading on several dimensions, starting with speed. Sophisticated trading systems need high throughput and low latency to support native order books and ensure that orders are priced correctly. Vega\u2019s consensus layer achieves this with its 1 second block time and ability to process thousands of transactions per block, with instant finality.\n\nThe architecture\u2019s second optimization deals with fees. Vega\u2019s mainnet will offer continuous trading through either an on-chain central limit order book (CLOB) or a hybrid design using both an automated market maker (AMM) and a CLOB. In this system, limit orders are valuable because they provide information and liquidity to the market. While generic blockchains charge fees based on the computing power needed to process a transaction, Vega wants to incentivize limit orders, so there is no fee to place orders on the Vega chain. Fees are only charged when orders execute. To prevent order spamming, Vega has implemented client-side proof-of-work for transactions, so as a user starts putting more orders into a block it becomes more expensive (in terms of effort in the proof of work) for a transaction to be accepted into the mempool.\n\nAnother issue facing DeFi is that entities such as miners often use the transparency of the blockchain to front-run profitable transactions. To neutralize this Vega designed an ordering protocol called Wendy. Wendy runs alongside consensus and uses the same trust assumptions about validators as proof-of-stake. So, if at least two-thirds of validators are honest about when they see messages, users can be assured that transactions will be ordered fairly.\n\nMarkets\n\nOn top of the Vega network lie its markets. In traditional finance, market makers and exchanges, such as Goldman Sachs and the CME Group, are gatekeepers that decide the \u2018who\u2019 and \u2018what\u2019 for market creation and trading. Vega disintermediates this process and allows anyone to create open (public) markets using customizable modules. This creation process is relatively accessible thanks to Vega\u2019s WebAssembly compiler, which lets participants build instruments and smart products with just about any high-level programming language. Since Vega markets are layered, prospective architects will start at the base, the product layer.\n\nAnother way to visualize markets on Vega. Source: Vega Whitepaper\n\nThe product layer allows anyone to pseudonymously create any type of market. Users can set up more traditional markets, such as spot swaps, futures, options, and perpetual swaps, or design new markets altogether, as long as they specify how to value the product and calculate settlement flows. The product creator must also specify when to calculate settlement, which could be as cash flows are generated (recurring), when positions are closed, or at an expiry date. Another important piece of product logic is the trading mode, which can range from open continuous trading through a CLOB to private, closed, over-the-counter (OTC) trades via off-chain matching. Finally, the user specifies the parameters (i.e., strike price, date of expiry, maximum leverage, etc.).\n\nOn top of the product layer, the next layer of abstraction that users can build on is the instrument layer. An instrument is just a product with filled parameters. An example is filling in the parameters for a generic call option product to create a BTC call option instrument; e.g., reference to a pre-approved oracle for the price of BTC, a strike price of $100,000, and an expiration date of 12/31/2022.\n\nFinally, to make the instrument tradable, it must be combined with one of Vega\u2019s risk models and appropriate values for the risk model\u2019s parameters. The risk model\u2019s main job is to determine the collateralization requirement for open positions. Once a tradable instrument has been proposed for open market listing, it will be voted on by Vega\u2019s on-chain governance.\n\nLiquidity and Market Making\n\nManaging liquidity is crucial for decentralized exchanges since insufficient liquidity makes it difficult to execute trades without significant price impact. Vega attempts to attract liquidity from different angles with the ultimate goal of providing valuable liquidity, meaning liquidity that trades.\n\nLiquidity pricing is based on open interest, trading volume, and current liquidity (i.e., order book depth), among other factors. The objective is to price liquidity so that it flows to markets that have the greatest need.\n\nLiquidity Supply vs. Cost of Liquidity. Source: Vega Whitepaper\n\nVega also uses an owner-operator model for market makers to steer liquidity to markets that need it. Market makers receive an equity-like stake in trading fees, proportional to the trading volume in a market when they added liquidity. Thus, market makers are incentivized to seed or create good markets and provide long-term support.\n\nBecause most open markets on Vega will trade continuously through the hybrid AMM-CLOB, a market maker can choose to either be active or passive. Active market makers, as the name suggests, actively manage pricing for their volume and must do so within a specified band around the last traded price. Passive market makers have their capital deployed automatically and algorithmically based on market prices. Even though CLOBs are much better than AMMs for trading derivatives, they are considerably worse for bootstrapping liquidity, so the AMM is an important complement in the early and illiquid phases of a market.\n\nBoth active and passive market makers will earn trading fees in exchange for providing liquidity. Trading fees will initially be bundled into a reward pool and then distributed to individual market makers based on their equity-like market share (stake in the trading fee pool), activity (active market makers with competitive prices earn more), and length of their market-making commitment. In general, fees will come from the price (liquidity) taker and be distributed to the price maker in the particular trade, infrastructure providers (validators), and, as outlined above, the market maker reward pool.\n\nAnyone can become a market maker as long as they provide a financial stake, using the traded assets, as a bond. If they fail to provide active volume in proportion to their financial stake, they are penalized and lose part of the stake to the insurance pool. This mechanism helps prevent liquidity shocks.\n\nTrading\n\nIrrespective of liquidity, new markets start in an auction setting to discover the initial price, before moving to their normal trading mode. During regular trading, protective auctions are a backup, only run when circuit breakers are triggered. These protective auctions start when a market crosses the predefined threshold (as defined by its risk model) for price volatility or low liquidity. Under such circumstances, auctions let participants figure out a fair market price or source liquidity.\n\nOnce an open market does find its initial price, it starts its normal trading mode. Continuous trading will either use a standard CLOB or a hybrid AMM-CLOB. Discrete trading translates into frequent batch auctions, introduced as a way to neutralize high-frequency trading.\n\nLess common but still useful are ad-hoc markets, which are closed (private), and usually created for one-off use. Commonly referred to as over-the-counter (OTC), in these trades, a party can advertise a trade and select the best bid (called a request for quote) or two parties can agree to a price off-chain (called a matched trade) and use the Vega network for execution and settlement.\n\nCollateral and Settlement\n\nThe first requirement when trading a margined financial instrument is to have sufficient collateral. This is especially important for Vega since all market participants operate under pseudonymity, so the protocol cannot gauge creditworthiness or have recourse. Since Vega doesn\u2019t have any native network assets, it needs to source collateral and trading capital from other chains. Even though Vega\u2019s use of Tendermint makes it a part of the Cosmos ecosystem, it was designed before the Cosmos SDK or Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC) and has not bridged to the Cosmos Hub due to the overhead from network requirements. Instead, Vega has its own Ethereum-based ERC-20 bridge, since Ethereum still holds the majority of liquid, tradable value. Any ERC-20 can be used as a market\u2019s base currency (for pricing, settlement, and margin).\n\nOnce a user has deposited collateral to Vega from the host chain they can place an order, which will reserve a certain amount of margin. If the order trades and a position is generated, Vega will start monitoring that position through its collateral manager module. Since there is no recourse if a trader owes more than their collateral, positions must be resolved while a trader\u2019s margin is greater than their loss. Hence, risk parameters such as initial margin (to open a position) and maintenance margin (to keep a position open) are stringent. However, rather than just bloating margin requirements, Vega uses live position monitoring, continuous risk recalculation, cross-margining, and (opt-in) automatic recapitalization to bolster capital efficiency.\n\nContinuous monitoring lowers margin costs because it compresses the time over which a position can move against a trader, so Vega ends up needing less collateral. Constant P&L monitoring also allows for cross margining, meaning that positions in profit can release some margin to offset losses and net margin across markets without having to close positions. The settlement engine also automatically sweeps funds back into a user\u2019s wallet once a position closes, and if a user opts in, it can also automatically sweep funds from a wallet into a position approaching its maintenance margin.\n\nAs soon as a trader\u2019s available collateral falls below the maintenance margin, the position is closed out. Referred to as \u201catomic closeouts,\u201d these instant liquidations by the protocol prevent further price movement against the position. Liquidations are designed so that positions are closed out with a net positive margin. This remaining sum is then added to the market\u2019s insurance pool to cover any position closed out with a negative balance.\n\nThe VEGA Token\n\nVEGA is the Vega Protocol\u2019s Ethereum-based, ERC-20 staking and governance token.\n\nVega is a delegated proof-of-stake blockchain, which means that the validator nodes running the network need to have, at least, a certain amount of VEGA staked. However, participants holding any balance of VEGA can delegate their stake to validator nodes. Stakers (validators and delegating token holders) earn a share of trading fees for securing and running the network, which means the fundamental value of VEGA will increase with the protocol\u2019s trading volume.\n\nUnlike most blockchains, traders on Vega are not required to buy and use VEGA to access the protocol since there are no gas fees.\n\nVEGA also allows tokenholders, whether they have delegated their tokens or not, to create and vote on governance proposals. Governance proposals cover the creation of new markets, the alteration of parameters in active markets, or changes in network (chain) parameters (e.g., the infrastructure fee given to stakers).\n\nMost token allocations have already started vesting and will vest linearly into late 2023. Locked tokenholders can still stake and vote.\n\nUp Next for Vega\n\nCurrently, there are two ways to use Vega: through the restricted mainnet or through Fairground, the third iteration (v3) of the Vega Protocol testnet. Vega\u2019s restricted mainnet, capped at 13 validators, only allows token staking/delegation and governance voting for the Alpha Mainnet. Fairground allows prospective users to try out some features using testnet assets, including market creation, liquidity provision, and continuous trading through the Vega Console (limited to cash-settled futures through a CLOB).\n\nIn the coming weeks, Vega will launch its Alpha Mainnet. Alpha Mainnet market creation and trading will be limited to CLOB-only cash-settled futures, with deposit limits and withdrawal delays for large sums. As the network proves to be secure, reliable and functioning as planned, restrictions will be phased out through on-chain governance.\n\nCompetition\n\nVega is a decentralized exchange (DEX), and given its wide scope, to allow permissionless trading and the creation of virtually any market, it technically competes against almost all DEXs. However, Vega\u2019s focus on margin trading means its core competitors are protocols focusing on perpetuals (e.g., dYdX, Perp), options (e.g., Dopex, Lyra), or a mix of markets such as GMX for spot swaps and perpetuals, and Zeta Markets for options and futures.\n\nCrypto Derivatives Competitive Landscape. Source: Jump Crypto\n\ndYdX is currently far and away the largest on-chain derivatives exchange by trading volume. dYdX only supports one product (perpetuals), has permissioned market creation and an off-chain, centralized order book and trade matching engine. Additionally, the dYdX governance token has virtually no value accrual. Nonetheless, dYdX has a valuable token and does over $1 billion in trading volume every day. Even though a large part of this volume comes from unsustainable trading incentives, some of its success is due to speed and usability that is comparable to centralized exchanges. However, dYdX is moving towards Vega\u2019s model with dYdX V4, which focuses on decentralization (order book, matching engine, market creation, etc.) and distributing trading fees to tokenholders.\n\nFrom a competitive point of view, dYdX\u2019s transition is mixed news for Vega. While dYdX V4 poses a competitive threat due to the overlap in specifications, it also leaves dYdX vulnerable during its transition. Additionally, we still don\u2019t know if fully decentralized, permissionless, on-chain derivatives really work or can compete against their centralized counterparts, since a lot of dYdX\u2019s volume has been bootstrapped through incentives and centralization. Whether or not Vega, or for that matter dYdX, will be able to attract meaningful volume to (fully) decentralized derivatives exchanges or fall prey to the same problems facing existing protocols, such as user experience (UX) complexity, high latency/flash crashes, and challenges around sourcing/placing liquidity is still an open question.\n\nRisks\n\nVega tries to solve some of these problems by introducing a modular trading interface (Vega Console), offering 1 second block times with high throughput and creating unique incentives around liquidity. However, there are still some unknowns, including UX friction and security concerns associated with cross-chain bridging and the (required) Vega Wallet. There is also uncertainty around the protocol\u2019s ability to execute high, organic volume across different product types and around the reliability of its first-of-a-kind liquidity model. Additionally, by bootstrapping its own network (blockchain), Vega doesn\u2019t inherit the security or composability/network effects of pre-existing monolithic chains (i.e., Ethereum, Solana, etc.). The security aspect, in particular, can result in a malicious actor taking control over the Vega network by subverting the consensus mechanism. Finally, Vega will face some of the same challenges as other on-chain derivatives exchanges around market manipulation and dubious/unreliable oracle data.\n\nClosing Thoughts\n\nThe London Metals Exchange (LME) nickel-trading fiasco could have been averted on an open, decentralized system like Vega.\n\nFor starters, on March 7th, the day before the contract cancellations, the price of nickel saw a 30 standard deviation move. Despite the extreme price move, LME governance failed to use its discretion to suspend trading. Vega, on the other hand, uses a transparent, preset threshold to trigger circuit breakers and move the market into a protective auction.\n\nLME\u2019s trades were canceled because the Tsingshan Holding Group, and others, could not meet margin calls and in some cases faced bankruptcy. In Vega, margin is continuously monitored, and stringent risk parameters ensure that the margin posted is always greater than a trader\u2019s loss, guaranteeing solvency. Once a trader\u2019s margin does fall below the minimum collateral requirement (maintenance margin), there is an instant, permissionless liquidation by the protocol, ensuring that the position stops moving against the trader.\n\nFinally, Vega runs on a blockchain. This means orders and liquidations are immutable, and no central authority can easily change the network\u2019s rules.\n\nIn the US equity market, options volume is 35 times that of spot, but in crypto, it\u2019s 2%, with most volume coming from centralized exchanges. This number means there is either a lack of demand or a massive opportunity, and given the dearth of good choices, the latter seems more likely. Vega wants to become a leading player in this space by solving the problems that plague on-chain derivatives: fragmentation, high latency, capital inefficiency, and poor liquidity management. If execution matches ambition, Vega has the opportunity to change the face of decentralized derivatives trading and become a centerpiece of DeFi.\n\nThis report was commissioned by Vega, a member of Protocol Services.

Each chain built within Polkadot uses Parity Technologies\u2019 blockchain development framework Substrate, which allows developers to select specific components that best suit their application-specific chain. Polkadot refers to the entire ecosystem of parachains that plug into a single base platform known as the Relay Chain. This base platform does not support application functionality but instead houses all validators and is responsible for securing, governing, and connecting the parachains.\n\nFollowing roughly five years of research and development, the first parachains were launched on Dec. 17, 2021. At Q1 2022 close, 13 parachains have won parachain slots bonding 127.8 million DOT (11% of the total supply, worth $2.9 billion). As the first edition of quarterly coverage on Polkadot, this report will highlight important developments since the launch of parachains and evaluate the network\u2019s Q1 performance. A full appendix of quarterly events and data is available at the end of the report.\n\nPrice History\n\nThe concept of parachains was first introduced in the Polkadot Paper in 2016. In October 2021, at the Substrate Sub0 conference, Co-Founder Robert Habermeier announced the Relay Chain was ready to support parachains. Over the following three weeks, the price of Polkadot\u2019s native token DOT increased 57% to an all-time-high of $55.08 ($56.5 billion market cap) on Nov. 5, 2021, one day after the community approved the first parachain slot auction for Nov. 11, 2021. However, Polkadot, along with the broader crypto market, saw valuations decrease from November 2021 through Q1 2022. DOT ended Q1 2022 at $22.5 ($23.3 billion market cap), down 60% from the all-time-high.\n\nDuring Q1 2022, Polkadot\u2019s valuation change was in range with changes in other ecosystems. LUNA was the largest gainer at +18%, FTM had the largest drop at -38%, and Polkadot had the third largest drop at -19%.\n\nNetwork Usage\n\nPolkadot user accounts, both new and active, followed a path similar to price. In November, user accounts were up 131% over the year-to-date average and recorded multiple all-time-highs. However, each month since November saw a drop in both active and new users accounts. Although the drop in user accounts was a common macro theme, some internal reasons were also responsible.\n\nThe decrease in active accounts may be the result of users locking their DOT for the two-year lease period to support their desired parachain(s) in a slot auction. DOT locked in a crowd loan is inaccessible and therefore cannot be used across Polkadot. To combat the liquidity constraint, parachains Acala and Parallel Finance have introduced liquid staking.\n\nThe decrease in new accounts may be related to the fact that the first batch of parachains generated significantly more excitement than the second batch. The first batch of parachains (1\u20135) had 342% more DOT bonded than the second batch of parachains (6\u201311).\n\nConversely, the number of addresses holding DOT increased every month of 2021 and Q1 2022. The increase signals healthy interest in the Polkadot ecosystem despite decreasing valuations.\n\nStaking and Decentralization\n\nPolkadot uses a Nominated Proof-of-Stake (NPoS) consensus mechanism. Nominated PoS consensus differs from Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPos) consensus because nominators, i.e. DOT owners who stake their tokens with a validator, are subject to slashing.\n\nValidators are paid every 24 hours for completing payable actions, known as era points. Every 4 hours, a subset of validators are randomly assigned to validate all parachains with a multiplier on the era points earned. The combination of era points and random parachain validation results in a probabilistic guarantee that validators earn nearly identical rewards. Because validators earn near equal rewards and distribute these rewards pro rata to their nominators, nominators are incentivized to stake with lower-staked validators to earn higher rewards. The validator-nominator reward model is designed to decentralize Polkadot\u2019s validator set. At Q1 2022 close, 294 of 297 (99%) of validators had 1.8\u20132.6 million DOT staked, confirming the nominator staking game theory is working.\n\nPolkadot uses an inflationary token model; therefore, there is no maximum number of DOT. Inflation rewards are distributed to validators for securing the Polkadot network, with the remainder going to the treasury. The inflation rate varies in relation to Polkadot\u2019s ideal staking rate, but averages approximately 10% annually. During Q1 2022, DOT maintained a consistent staking rate with a range of 53.8% to 58.6% of total DOT tokens staked.\n\nIt is possible for a single entity to run multiple validators. According to Subscan, in Q1 2022 there were seven entities running multiple validators, accounting for 20% of the total DOT staked. It is possible that additional entities are running multiple validators, but Subscan has not identified them.\n\nBecause of the even rewards distribution, running multiple validators nets a greater expected value. As a result, Polkadot validators self-bond the minimum of one DOT and nominate their DOT across a maximum of 16 validators to maximize the expected value of their staking rewards. Of the total DOT staked, roughly 99.7% is from nominators, and 0.3% is from validators self-bonding.\n\nParachain Auctions\n\nThe first parachain slot auction began on Nov. 11, 2021. At Q1 2022 close, 13 parachains won parachain slots bonding 127.8 million DOT (11% of the total supply, worth $2.9 billion). Polkadot has 28 new slot auctions scheduled through February 2023 (bringing the total to 41).  \n\nOf the first 13 parachains, seven are DeFi chains, three are smart contract platforms, and three are Web3 infrastructure chains. For a deeper look at each of the first 13 parachains, checkout the Polkadot Ecosystem Overview.\n\nPolkadot vs. Kusama\n\nAnother unique component of the Polkadot ecosystem is the canary network Kusama. Kusama is a sovereign blockchain with a nearly identical codebase and architecture as Polkadot; however, Kusama has a quicker governance mechanism with 7-day voting vs. Polkadot\u2019s 28-day voting. All new code rollouts are proposed, approved, tested, and implemented on Kusama before moving to Polkadot. As such, Polkadot and Kusama are closely related. Over the last five quarters, the market caps of both networks have closely tracked each other with a 0.797 correlation coefficient.\n\nConversely, user activity between the networks has little correlation. Over the last five quarters, the user accounts of both networks have had a weak 0.42 correlation coefficient. Both of the networks have seen user accounts trending downwards following the first Polkadot parachains.\n\nSimilar to the Kusama-Polkadot relationship, parachain project teams can launch a Kusama parachain to test new features under real economic conditions. Of the first 13 Polkadot parachains, 11 have Kusama parachains. On average, the Polkadot parachains locked ten times the USD value of the Kusama parachains. The lone exception was the Polkadot parachain Phala Network which had a greater USD value locked on its Kusama parachain Khala Network.\n\nDeveloper Overview\n\nPolkadot had the second largest developer community in 2021, according to the annual Electric Capital Developer Report. Polkadot began the year with 840 total developers and ended the year with 1,400 total developers, a net gain of 560 total developers (+67%). For comparison, Ethereum had the most developers with 3,920, and Cosmos had the third most with roughly 950.\n\nDeveloper activity through 2021 and Q1 2022 was consistent, with 14/15 months (93%) registering over 10,000 developer activity events. The exception, October 2021, was a result of developers shifting focus to supporting prospective parachains in anticipation of the inaugural auctions. Q1 2022 saw a 10% drop in average monthly developer activity as developers prioritized enabling previously deployed features rather than developing new features. Overall, Polkadot\u2019s developer activity is among the strongest in crypto.\n\nEcosystem Challenges\n\nIn Q4 2021, new users flooded Polkadot to partake in the inaugural, novel parachain slot auctions. However, excitement surrounding the ecosystem has steadily declined through Q1 2022.\n\nTo jumpstart excitement, Polkadot needs a spark, likely driven by a parachain or a protocol built on top of a parachain. A protocol needs to develop a new primitive(s) utilizing the cross-chain architecture and XCM communication. Developing new functionality and use cases will showcase the power of the network and organically attract users.\n\nAdditionally, users on the network often complain about the complexity of the Polkadot JS wallet. As of Q1 2022 close, multiple projects are working on a Polkadot ecosystem wallet including Talisman, SubWallet, Nova, and Polka Wallet.\n\nLastly, Polkadot suffers from a knowledge gap. The uniqueness of the architecture leads to common questions and comparisons with other open economy ecosystems. Polkadot could benefit from increased marketing and education efforts to combat common misconceptions.\n\nThe Road Ahead\n\nThe launch of Polkadot began in May 2020 with the Relay Chain genesis block and finished in December 2021 with the launch of parachains. Several post-launch developments and optimizations have been implemented in Q1 2022, and they are expected to continue through 2022.\n\nArguably the most important area of focus is the buildout of Polkadot\u2019s Cross-Consensus Message Format (XCM). XCM is a communication language allowing parachains to exchange messages with other parachains, similar to Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) on Cosmos. Kusama, Polkadot\u2019s canary network, has been testing a light client version of XCM, called HRMP. Expectations are that XCM will be implemented on Polkadot in Q2 2022. Update, Co-Founder Robert Habermeier tweeted on Apr. 17, 2022 that XCM would be launched on Polkadot during the next runtime upgrade.\n\nAnother area of focus is the launch of parathreads. Parathreads are pay-as-you-go parachains. Instead of always being connected to the Relay Chain like parachains, parathreads pay for the Relay Chain\u2019s security and interoperability as needed. Parathreads are useful for projects that do not wish to acquire a full parachain slot and/or existing parachains that no longer require a dedicated parachain slot.\n\nLastly, the developers will continue optimizing the network's performance. One major performance upgrade will come from Asynchronous Backing. It will allow parachains to build blocks concurrently with the relay chain and reduce the block time from 12s to 6s. Additional protocol updates are also in-development.\n\nClosing Summary\n\nThe marquee event of 2021 was the launch of parachains. Parachains going live led to all-time-highs in price, user accounts, and parachain slot auction contributions. Unfortunately, the euphoria was short lived, and each of these metrics experienced month-over-month declines through Q1 2022.\n\nDuring the same period, the foundational KPIs held steady. Polkadot maintained a healthy validator distribution by total stake, developer activity remained among the strongest in crypto, and users continued acquiring the token, signaling a healthy interest in the ecosystem.\n\nQ2 2022 will be characterized by additional parachains coming online and the rollout of XCM. To gain more market share, Polkadot needs a parachain or a protocol built on a parachain to take advantage of XCM and the cross-chain architecture by building a unique use case. Because parachains only launched 4 months ago, they are still in their early days.\n\nAppendix\n\n  \nEvents\n\nOctober 13, 2021 - Robert Habermeier Announces Parachains\nNovember 11, 2021 - First Parachain Auction Begin \nNovember 18, 2021 - Acala Wins 1st Parachain Slot \nNovember 25, 2021 - Moonbeam Wins 2nd Parachain Slot \nDecember 2, 2021 - Astar Wins 3rd Parachain Slot\nDecember 9, 2021 - Parallel Wins 4th Parachain Slot\nDecember 15, 2021 - Polkadot Re-Brand\nDecember 16, 2021 - Clover Wins 5th Parachain Slot\nDecember 17, 2021 - Parachains 1\u20135 Connected to Relay Chain\nDecember 30, 2021 - Efinity Wins 6th Parachain Slot\nJanuary 13, 2022 - Composable Wins 7th Parachain Slot\nJanuary 27, 2022 - Centrifuge Wins 8th Parachain Slot\nFebruary 2, 2022 - Report Polkadot Has Smallest Carbon Footprint\nFebruary 10, 2022 - HydraDX Wins 9th Parachain Slot\nFebruary 24, 2022 - Interlay Wins 10th Parachain Slot\nFebruary 24, 2022 - 30 Additional Auctions Scheduled\nMarch 10, 2022 - Nodle Wins 11th Parachain Slot\nMarch 19, 2022 - Equilibrium Wins 12th Parachain Slot\nMarch 31, 2022 - Phala Wins 13th Parachain Slot\n\n This report was commissioned by Polkadot, a member of Protocol Services.

Premia is designing its architecture based on these principles.\nThe protocol Smart Deposit Optimization Framework aims to make options strategies more accessible to a broader range of buyers.\nThe market that Premia operates in is in its infancy and its success will be dependent on protocols\u2019 ability to attract options buyers at scale.\n\nOptions are an important part of TradFi markets but have seen slow adoption in DeFi. However, DeFi options protocols have seen a general increase in interest in the last year, and particularly in the last month. On March 1st, the total value locked (TVL) across all option protocols was $446.6M and on March 31st, the TVL was $665.6M. While there were minimal fluctuations throughout the month, the TVL on option protocols increased nearly 50% in March.\n\nDeFi options vaults \u2013 think Yearn for options \u2013 in particular have become popular with retail investors. This is for good reason. They are accessible, relatively simple to use, and provide a high organic yield. By simply depositing their assets into a vault, ordinary investors get access to option premiums without having to deal with options directly. On top of the yield from option premiums, users may earn token rewards, and staking yield.\n\nDeFi options vaults come in two flavors, standalone and packaged with an AMM (peer-to-pool). The latter aims to aggregate liquidity across options series. However, AMMs were designed for spot trading. As such, these \u201cpeer-to-pool\u201d protocols had to modify the AMM pooled liquidity model to make it suitable for the convexity of options.\n\nPremia is a DeFi-native options protocol that has been generating particularly attractive returns for its users. Think mid-to-high double digits. It is taking an innovative approach to both AMM design and making DeFi options retail user friendly.\n\nIn this report we will give an overview of the Premia protocol, its secret sauce, tokenomics, traction, competitive landscape and risk factors. Let\u2019s start with a lay of the land on DeFi options protocols.\n\nLay of the Land on DeFi Options Protocols\n\nThere are two types of on-chain options protocols: market places and structured products. So far, structured product vaults have driven the large majority of the adoption.\n\nMarketplaces create the actual option contract and facilitate buying and selling. Protocols like Opyn, PsyOptions, and Zeta all operate a traditional order book.\n\nStructured product protocols sit on top of options marketplaces and offer vaults for users to deposit funds into. Each vault executes a defined options-based yield strategy. Similar to Yearn, these protocols are abstracting complexities away for the user. The most prominent structured product vaults engage in selling covered-calls and/or cash-margined puts.\n\nLiquidity pool marketplaces combine the two approaches, sourcing liquidity and underwriting options in the same protocol. They are also called \u201cpeer-to-pool\u201d marketplaces and typically utilize a liquidity pool (AMM) method vs. an order book.\n\nPremia falls into this category with its DeFi-native approach to options.\n\nOverview of Premia\n\nPremia\u2019s mission is to enable anyone to buy and sell American options in a fair and liquidity efficient way. It offers call and put underwriting through its vaults that are attracting retail investors looking for yield. The other side of the trade is taken by traders. Premia currently offers call and put markets for ETH, BTC, LUNA, YFI, LINK, ALCX, and alETH. The protocol is deployed on Ethereum, Arbitrum, and BSC. Its total value locked (TVL) on Ethereum, Arbitrum, and BSC is $6.34M, $8.81M, and $11.03K, respectively.\n\nThe Mechanics\n\nLiquidity Pools\n\nEach available asset pair has a call and a put pool. Call pools are underwritten in the underlying asset and put pools are underwritten in DAI. The two-pool structure gives LPs control over which strategies to underwrite. In other words, demand from buyers and sellers (strike price, expiration date, size) doesn\u2019t have to match. This is in stark contrast to the traditional order-book model where these parameters typically must align.\n\nTransaction Flow\n\nUsers simply specify the desired option details (option type, asset pair, strike, expiration date, quantity) and the pool returns a quote. Users then execute the trade in an on-chain transaction. The option is represented as an ERC-1155 token, allowing transfer or exercise at any time on or before expiration.\n\nThe ERC-1155 standard allows protocols to map unbalanced option rights and obligations between buyer and seller. It supports operations on unlimited numbers and types of non-fungible tokens within the same smart contract.\n\nExercising and Settlement\n\nOptions can be exercised at any time after purchase, in full or in part. If at the time of expiration an option is in-the-money, the payoff is locked in. It can then be claimed by the holder at any time post expiration. Options are cash-settled.\n\nA recently introduced Sell Feature allows traders to sell options back to the pool at any time. Previously, traders had to find a counterparty to accept the trade on an NFT marketplace to sell their options prior to expiration. This feature also benefits liquidity providers because they can pull their capital out early or place their capital in a new position, enabling them to earn on several positions.\n\nPool Accounting & LP Returns\n\nFIFO accounting. LPs select a pool and the amount they would like to deposit. Deposits are sequenced on a first-in, first-out basis. To facilitate this, all of the available liquidity (or \u201cFree Capital\u201d) in a pool, is sequenced in terms of intervals. Each interval is defined by: (1) LP wallet address, (2) interval number, (3) interval size (in monetary terms).\n\nA buy order will scan as many liquidity intervals as are needed to cover the position size. The transaction will mint ERC-1155 tokens for all LP interval owners involved. Once the option is purchased, each liquidity interval is updated. The transaction also mints an ERC-1155 token for the buyer, embedding all option parameters.\n\nOption exercise & settlement. When an option is exercised, the position is settled in the same transaction. The option holder receives the payoff, and the newly freed capital is returned to the pool.\n\nWithdrawals. Liquidity providers can withdraw their un-utilized free capital in a pool at any moment in time. If an LP would like to remove active (underwritten option) capital from a pool, they have two choices:\n\nPay the pool price to sell the option to another underwriter in the pool;\nUse the \u201cGradual Withdrawal\u201d feature to prevent their capital from being used to underwrite future options after expiration.\n\nHow does the protocol make money?\n\nPremia is charging fees to support the growth and long-term sustainability of the protocol:\n\nOption buyers are charged a 3% Protocol Fee at the time of purchase charged on the option\u2019s base price and included in the quote;\nLPs are charged a 2.5% Utilization Fee (see below).  \n\nA successful proposal recently replaced a 3% Exercise Fee with the Utilization fee. The problem with the Exercise Fee was that (1) it charged option buyers for a second time for the same transaction, and (2) there were no fees for options that expired out-of-the-money but did utilize capital. All of this resulted in unbalanced fee incentives.\n\nThe new Utilization Fee is a 2.5% annualized interest rate. It is calculated taking into account both the amount of capital locked and the period of time the capital was utilized. It is paid by the LP at settlement (exercise, secondary sale, or expiry) and taken from the collateral stored in the option.\n\nTo reward long-term supporters of the protocol, 80% of fees are paid as a protocol fee to $PREMIA stakers. The remaining 20% of fees go to the PREMIA treasury.\n\nProtocol expenses include Chainlink services (price feeds, nodes, keeper), The Graph\u2019s on-chain indexing and open-source DB/API service, and contract deployments. All of these must be maintained on a per-chain basis.\n\nPremia\u2019s Secret Sauce\n\nThe problem with using a spot AMM model for options\n\nPooled liquidity (AMM structure) has benefits. However, a simple bonding curve AMM only accounts for changes in token reserve. Options pricing takes multiple variables into account: spot price, volatility of the underlying asset, the risk free interest rate, and the strike price and duration of the option. All of these are dynamic and change on a trade by trade basis.\n\nTradFi options are typically priced using the Black-Scholes Model (BSM). To establish a robust equilibrium price in options AMMs it is important to both establish an accurate input for volatility and take into account market flows.\n\nVolatility is typically estimated by looking at both historical volatility and a live \u201cvolatility surface.\u201d The latter is a three-dimensional representation of the observed implied volatility of existing options on the asset from a range of strike prices and expiry dates. Volatility surfaces are complex to establish on-chain and either need to be held off-chain or approximated.\n\nPremia is offering a novel solution to these problems withs its implied volatility surface and c-level features. In addition, it aims to make DeFi options yields accessible to a broader audience. Through its smart deposit optimization framework, the protocol provides example portfolios to liquidity providers.\n\nLet\u2019s have a look at these key elements of Premia\u2019s \u201csecret sauce.\u201d\n\nImplied Volatility Surface\n\nA live implied volatility surface is crucial to providing an accurate approximation of the market-clearing price of an option based on the liquidity conditions present in DeFi markets. In absence of such a tool in DeFi, Premia launched its own Volatility Surface oracle. It is calculated off-chain and periodically reports the updated surface via Chainlink. To construct the surface, Premia uses a volume-weighted combination of the most liquid CEX options data, together with data from trades executed on the Premia platform.\n\nThe image above depicts the volatility surface of a BTC call option circa October 2021. Source: Premia Gitbook\n\nC-Level\n\nThe C-level is an equilibrium mechanism to address shortcomings of the BSM, which uses simplified assumptions that ignore (1) market supply and demand, (2) \u201cAmerican\u201d style exercise, and (3) asset-specific volatility dynamics. The mechanism is a coefficient that fluctuates based on real-time liquidity and demand for buying options. When the coefficient is multiplied by the BSM-determined option price, it adjusts the price levels in option pools to market supply and demand.\n\nSmart Deposit Optimization Framework\n\nThe smart deposit optimization framework provides portfolio optimization for LPs. This framework gives LPs example portfolios which may help optimize yield according to local market supply and demand conditions. It allows users to automatically optimize their pool deposits to have the minimum impact on pool price levels.\n\nThe $Premia Token\n\nPremia\u2019s $PREMIA token is an ERC-1155 utility and governance token.\n\nPremia\u2019s token\u2019s supply is fixed at 100 million. The initial token distribution of 10 million PREMIA tokens was conducted on February 7, 2021. Of the remaining 90 million tokens, 10 million were allocated to its founding team. Furthermore, Premia allocated 20% to its Development Fund, 5% to marketing and education, and 5% to ecosystem grants.\n\nAccording to CoinGecko, the circulating supply is currently $10.6M. The circulating supply does not include the 10 million allocated to the founding team as these are still locked in a vesting schedule. Premia\u2019s fully diluted market capitalization, which is the value of the entire token supply at current prices, is $167million at the date of publication.\n\n$PREMIA accrues value to token holders through its liquidity mining program and staking mechanisms. Premia\u2019s Cross-Chain Liquidity Mining Fund received the highest token allocation at 30%. Liquidity providers receive $PREMIA tokens as compensation for lending their assets. $PREMIA stakers collect the bulk, an estimated 80%, of the protocol\u2019s fees. All $PREMIA holders receive governance rights, which means that they can vote on new proposals and protocol decisions. Those who own at least 100 $PREMIA tokens can submit Community Proposals regarding changes to Premia\u2019s features and the protocol\u2019s future roadmap.\n\nTraction and Competitive Landscape\n\nTraction\n\nPremia\u2019s TVL is comparatively lower than top options protocols like Dopex and Ribbon Finance. However, Premia does seem to optimize capital efficiency effectively. Taking Dune data for Premia\u2019s ETH, WBTC, and Link pools it produces 25% annualized return on assets (ROA) for March 2022. This compares to 3.6% for Yearn and 30% for Ribbon over the same period.\n\nCompetitive Landscape\n\nThe table below compares Premia to its main competitors that employ a similar peer-to-pool model. Although smaller in terms of TVL, Premia is the only such protocol offering options with American exercise. The fungibility of its tokens also stands out.\n\nThe information above was sourced from multiple sources, including the Premia Gitbook, Dopex Gitbook, Lyra Gitbook, Etherscan, and DeFi Llama.\n\nRisks\n\nUser adoption\n\nThe on-chain DeFi options model is still in its infancy. Although retail demand for yield is strong, the challenge is in finding the other side of the trade on-chain. Protocols like Ribbon find buyers off-chain (typically market makers). Shifts in user behavior are crucial for protocols like Premia to scale.\n\nAmerican-style options are a double-edged sword\n\nAmerican-style exercise is the most popular in TradFi and Premia is the only protocol offering American options on EVM. However, American options are harder to price and also carry more LP risk. American options are more challenging to price because the traditional Black-Scholes pricing model neglects the asset\u2019s fluctuating valuation up until expiry. Other option pricing models designed for American options include the Tree/Binomial pricing model, which could be difficult to incorporate on decentralized platforms. American options incur LP risk from potential liquidity deficiencies as a result of early exercise. The Premia team attempts to mitigate this risk with its incentives structure, which is designed to attract LPs when liquidity is low.\n\nCompetition\n\nPremia also faces competition from both alternative DeFi derivatives instruments like perpetual swaps (perps) and competitors that use the more dominant options vault model that Ribbon employs.\n\nDifferentiation\n\nLike in any market, differentiation vs. competitors is key in attracting a captive client base. One way for Premia to differentiate could be to support popular tokens before its competitors. This has paid off for Dopex which supported OHM early.\n\nConclusion\n\nDeFi options markets are still in their infancy. The traction that these options markets have picked up in the last few months are mostly on the supply side. Liquidity providers are discovering that option protocols offer better yields than some legacy DeFi platforms, which is driving up TVL and volume on DeFi options platforms.\n\nHowever, the demand for options is still lagging. Although this introduces challenges, it also creates opportunities for protocols like Premia to innovate.\n\nIf the demand for options in DeFi markets eventually resembles the demand in TradFi markets, then Premia does not need to capture a significant chunk of the market share to do well. Instead, Premia\u2019s future relies on how it adapts to market conditions and develops cutting-edge features.\n\nThis report was commissioned by Premia, a member of Protocol Services.

Markets last week were showing signs of consolidation, which could indicate that big moves would be coming ahead. Judging from market sentiment, the moves could be in the downward direction. Losses this week ranged from -2.24% to -11.06% as the gaming sector took the biggest hit.\n\nTop Assets\n\nDogecoin (DOGE) was the only top asset by market capitalization that ended the week with a positive return. Just like the rest of the assets within the category, DOGE was trending downwards mid-week and was heading towards a 10% loss. However, markets went on a brief rally, and the original dog coin saw its price rise by as much as 36.2% following news that Elon Musk would be acquiring Twitter. DOGE has given back most of the gains since and finished the week just slightly above where it started (1.2%). \n\nDeFi Assets\n\nThe top DeFi sector assets went through a decline this week with the exception of two outliers \u2014 Kava (KAVA) and Curve (CRV). CRV started the week on solid footing as it achieved a 15% gain quickly and subsequently peaking at 22% by mid-week. The token lost momentum soon after and its price started to taper off; however, this was enough to secure its position in second place. On the other hand, KAVA, the Tendermint-based Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain\u2019s native asset, started the week around -5% territory but recovered lost ground and followed a steady trend upwards, only surpassing CRV\u2019s price at the last moment. It was the sector leader this week with a 15.1% return.\n\nSmart Contract Platforms\n\nIt was all red for the smart contract platform sector as all of its top assets finished the week underwater. Losses this week ranged from -1.1% all the way down to -20.3%. Ethereum (ETH) declined the least within the sector. Its token price visited the 5% decline territory at one point but was able to recover lost ground, finishing the week slightly below where it started. Interestingly, the two projects which recently announced that they will be launching their own native LUNA/UST-like algo stablecoins were the biggest losers this week. TRON (TRON) and NEAR (NEAR) ended the week with corresponding 11.3% and 20.3% declines.\n\nCurrencies\n\nSimilar to the top assets by market capitalization category, the currencies sector only had one asset end the week with a positive return. Dogecoin (DOGE) has benefitted from the string of media coverage that one of its biggest proponents, Elon Musk, has recently been receiving. News that Twitter accepted Elon Musk\u2019s buyout offer was enough to propel DOGE 36.2% from its weekly low. Although most of the gains have been returned, it was enough to secure the leading position within the sector. \n\nWeb3\n\nThe Web3 sector had a rocky week as most of the top assets had significant price action. Only The Graph (GRT) was able to end the week in positive territory. The decentralized indexing protocol\u2019s token ended the week with a 2.2% return. The rest of the sector\u2019s top assets saw losses ranging from 4.7% down to 14.7% with Theta Network\u2019s THETA token being the laggard of the group.\n\nGaming\n\nThe gaming sector was the worst performer of the week and the only one with a double-digit decline (11.1%). The sector appeared on track to have all its top assets end the week in the red; however, Yield Guild Games\u2019 token YGG had a 20% price rally at the last moment that was enough to secure its position as the top performer with a 2.3% return. Axie Infinity (AXS) lagged the group this week with a 17.3% decline.\n\n", "references": [{"name": "Guillermo Avil\u00e9s", "url": ""}], "published_at": "2022-04-29T14:21:00Z", "author": {"name": "Guillermo Avil\u00e9s"}, "tags": ["Macro"], "url": "https://messari.io/article/weekly-recap-ending-april-28"}, {"id": "2b66e512-0bf9-42ed-af2b-d885b7df07b7", "title": "State of Decentral Games Q1 2022", "content": "Download the PDF version of this report by clicking here.pdf).\n\nInteract with the real-time data that created this report on the Dune Analytics dashboard.\n\nKey Insights\n\nWith over 12,000 daily active users, Decentral Games is more active than most decentralized metaverses.\nDecentral Games operates on Polygon and is integrated within the Polygon Studios gaming and NFT ecosystem.\nICE Poker is the main game in the Decentral Games ecosystem. It earned $36 million in Q1 2022 from NFT activations, NFT mints, secondary sales fees, and in-game upgrades fees.\nImportant governance decisions made in Q1 2022 include adding in-game ads, featuring NFT mints in ICE, the native in-game currency, instead of ETH, and changing reward distributions.\nThe forthcoming launch of a simplified game mode via mobile app is expected to further increase the game\u2019s user base.\n\nPoker rooms typically make their revenue from commission fees called a rake. It\u2019s the cost of doing business, but there\u2019s usually still some disgruntlement by players about this; after all, the operator is effectively applying a tax on the game. So what about a poker room where a rake doesn\u2019t need to be applied? Or even, what about a poker room where players don\u2019t have to lose anything at all?\n\nDecentral Games in a Nutshell\n\nDecentral Games is a game operator within Decentraland, a 3-D browser-based world. It\u2019s designed to reward users through a play-to-earn mechanism. Those who commit time to play the game are given the means to build a collection of assets worth real-world money. Both fungible and non-fungible assets are incorporated within Decentral Games \u2014 users can self-custody assets, earn yield-based rewards, and take ownership of their in-game items.\n\nUnderneath the hood, Decentral Games uses Polygon as its scaling solution. A multifaceted partnership exists between the two entities: Decentral Games deploys its games on the Polygon network and is a member of Polygon Studio\u2019s ecosystem. The game platform also runs its own Polygon node.\n\nThe most successful game offered in the Decentral Games ecosystem is ICE Poker. It\u2019s where the focus of the development team \u2014 and of this report \u2014 resides. ICE Poker was launched in October 2021 and is based on Texas hold\u2019em, one of the most popular poker variations. Hold\u2019em was chosen with the intent to bring in more users. ICE Poker aims to tap into an existing player pool by not requiring users to learn a new game. As a result, ICE Poker is among the most active and fastest-growing decentralized virtual worlds.\n\nICE Poker had approximately 8,000 daily active users in Q1 2022, up over 500% from the previous quarter. Not only did the ICE Poker game see a surge in users, the metric only reflects the average over the quarter and not the trend. The trend, meanwhile, highlights a steady increase in daily active users. Reaching 10,000 daily users for the first time in Q1 2022 is good evidence that ICE Poker is overcoming the usual lack of users that most decentralized metaverses face.\n\nNotably, the last day of Q1 2022 did see a significant dip after reaching 12,000 daily active users before sharply rebounding in the beginning of April. This date coincided with the launch of a new feature, Assigned Seating, which launched with a few errant software bugs. Demand for Assigned Seating had been considerable, and after the bugs were fixed, daily users returned back to previous levels.\n\nWearable NFTs and Gameplay\n\nTo play ICE Poker, one needs to own or rent at least one in-game digital asset, i.e., a wearable NFT. Each wearable NFT starts as an ICE Rank 1 item (beginner) and can be upgraded up to ICE Rank 5 (colloquially known as diamond hand NFTs). Higher-ranked NFTs collect more rewards, which are paid out in ICE, the native in-game token. To move from one rank to another, owners must spend both ICE tokens and XP earned from completing gameplay challenges to level up their assets.\n\nSource: Decentral Games\n\nPlayers have the option of owning wearable NFTs outright (i.e., player-owner) or renting them (i.e., delegated player) from other NFT owners. Those with outright ownership may either acquire newly minted wearable NFTs or purchase them on secondary marketplaces like OpenSea (secondary sales). Ultimately, the decision remains a personal one. Poker players who are invested may want ownership of their own assets; meanwhile, metaverse \u201ctourists\u201d can choose to play without making any initial financial commitment. While delegated players face less risk, they have to split some of their earnings with the NFT owner.\n\nPlayer Metrics and Rewards\n\nAlmost all games with in-game economies suffer from inflationary pressures. ICE Poker is no exception: as players spend more time in the game and rank higher on the leaderboard, they are more likely to receive greater ICE rewards. With ICE Poker finishing up its first full quarter, it\u2019s worth tracking relevant in-game metrics. Let\u2019s start by understanding the economic incentives for players first.\n\nA visualization of the ecosystem\u2019s economic engine is shown above. By accessing a wearable NFT, a player gets a daily allocation of chips. These chips can only be used for playing poker within ICE Poker. Notice players themselves don\u2019t need to wager bets to play ICE Poker. Winning is measured in the number of ICE tokens earned. This essentially gives players a risk-free seat at the table: provided that players put the necessary time and effort into playing well, there is only upside potential. Each player is incentivized to perform a daily check-in, complete three daily challenges, and play well in exchange for ICE tokens and XP rewards. Gameplay rewards are calculated as follows:\n\nBased on each player\u2019s ranking on the daily leaderboard, a performance multiplier is applied to their earnings, which are paid in ICE. The higher a player ranks, the higher their ICE earnings.\nPlayers may also get ICE based on their wearable NFTs. There are five different wearable NFT ranks, each with corresponding rewards.\nAt the end of each month, players who are at the top of the leaderboard can earn additional DG tokens, granting them increased governance and fee share in the DG ecosystem.\n\nDecentral Games incentivizes ICE Poker players to reinvest their gameplay rewards into their own wearable NFT portfolios. Acquiring NFTs by primary sales requires people to mint the NFTs upon release. As of April 28, 2022, there have been 12 drops of ICE wearable NFTs dating back to November 2021. Each NFT drop is pegged with an associated label: recent names have been ICE Cyberpunk, ICE Spartan, and ICE Poet. Labels primarily exist to distinguish when the NFT was minted and don\u2019t have any impact on functionality.\n\nBy opting for a controlled NFT release schedule, Decentral Games believes its vertical progression is more sustainable than the burning-to-breed models of other games. Supply is actively managed without the risk of exponential growth. Notably, most mints are uniformly distributed among buyers, with 50% of new NFTs ending up in wallets with only one wearable. That number surges even higher to 91% when filtering for new mints ending up in wallets with two or fewer total wearables.\n\nA study of mint prices compared to the secondary sales price shows an opportunity for users to make a quick buck. In each of the 11 NFT drops we analyzed, the average secondary sales price was higher than the mint price. However, recent mints have become more expensive. For example, the average mint price of the first eight NFT drops was $1,237, while the average price for the last three NFT drops was $4,070. The higher starting price cuts into the eventual profits from flipping on the secondary market and encourages minters to utilize the NFT for non-speculative purposes instead.\n\nPoker Participants\n\nAfter renting or purchasing at least one wearable NFT, any user is granted table access. And although users can choose to either rent or purchase their wearable NFTs to gain table access, the ICE Poker ecosystem gains more when users purchase their NFTs. To incentivize player-owners to invest more resources into the ecosystem, ICE Poker encourages its users to upgrade their wearable NFTs.\n\nNotably, over the past months, it has become increasingly affordable for player-owners to upgrade their wearable NFTs. Although a higher ICE Rank still costs more to upgrade than a lower ICE Rank, the price gaps are starting to shrink. The lower prices may have incentivized player-owners to upgrade more often.\n\nIndeed, the general price decrease of upgrades coincided with a weekly 15% increase in the number of upgrades in recent months. It may thus be fair to discuss what benefits upgrades bring to player-owners. One might hypothesize that upgrades may correspond to generally higher prices for rarer wearable NFTs \u2014 intuitively, Rank 5 wearable NFTs should be more expensive to acquire on secondary markets than, for instance, those of Rank 1.\n\nHowever, upon inspecting secondary sales prices, wearable NFT prices generally stabilize around the $5,000 range. On average, Rank 1 NFTs sold for the lowest prices, followed by Rank 5 NFTs. Conversely, NFTs of Ranks 3 and 4 sold for the highest prices. While this may be partly related to sample size, the behavior is still a surprising one.\n\nPart of the explanation might be due to supply and demand. There were 3,487 sales of Rank 1 NFTs and 910 sales of Rank 5 NFTs in Q1 2022. Those volumes were multiples of the count for Rank 4 NFTs, which only had 79 transactions. Even Rank 3 NFTs only had 117 sales.\n\nAnother reason may be due to the gameplay itself. Purchasing a Rank 5 NFT could be seen as \u201ccheating\u201d the system; hardcore players might take this route to maximize reward, despite missing out on upgrade objectives. Altogether, there were 4,979 secondary sales in Q1 2022, which is significantly lower than the 9,477 total mints. These numbers suggest that there is not much selling activity \u2014 newly minted NFTs don\u2019t usually change hands. Instead, player-owners are active poker players or have started to transition towards being guild owners who rent their wearable NFTs to other participants.\n\nWhile gameplay requires a certain time investment, lending out wearable NFTs requires managing the performance of delegated players. The better those delegated players perform, the more revenue is accrued by a player-owner. Guild owners may find the second option attractive by choosing to delegate their guilds.\n\nGuild Owners\n\nICE Poker enables guild owners to maximize their returns by tracking the performance of the delegated players via the Delegation Dashboard. Importantly, guilds don\u2019t necessarily need to be wallets with dozens of NFTs; in the ICE poker ecosystem, a wallet with a single delegated NFT counts as a guild for the game\u2019s tracking purposes.\n\nOn-chain data shows there are more than 4,000 guild wallets, making up 23% of all ICE Poker NFT-owning wallets. Approximately 1,500 of those guild wallets delegate one wearable NFT; another 1,500 delegates out two to four; and 600 rent out five to nine wearables. The resulting 400 guilds manage more than 10 wearables.\n\nThis data confirms Decentral Games\u2019 aim of ensuring the gameplay ecosystem remains healthy in the long term. In this sense, ICE Poker did not do any pre-sale over-the-counter deals for industry insiders. Instead, ICE Poker wearable NFT drops were designed with a wide distribution in mind to incentivize gamers instead of tokenholders. That is, the goal is to incentivize the 77% of gameplay wallets to acquire their in-game wearable NFTs through organic mints or secondary sales. In doing so, the revenues generated by ICE Poker can be better sustained.\n\nICE Poker In-Game Economy\n\nApproximately six months after the game\u2019s launch, cumulative revenue from ICE Poker wearable NFTs reached over $40 million in Q1 2022. Minting accounts for the majority of ICE Poker revenue. In fact, almost 93% of ICE Poker revenue corresponds to mints and upgrades. The remaining 7% accounts for secondary sales and activations \u2014 this shows that only a small portion of revenues are accrued from the changing hands of wearable NFTs. Instead, once a wearable NFT is minted, most owners don\u2019t sell them and prefer to use them in-game or rent them out.\n\nOn a daily basis, mint revenue can be overrepresented on NFT drop days. Those particular days are vital for the protocol because revenue from mints comprises more than 70% of ICE Poker\u2019s cumulative revenue. For days without mints, upgrades then make up the majority of daily revenue.\n\nThe remaining two revenue streams (secondary sales and activations) make up for only a small fraction of protocol revenue. Combined, they max out to 50% of daily revenue but typically fall around 25% or less. This upgrade-heavy revenue model hints toward a healthy in-game economy where users are incentivized to upgrade, instead of cashing out and passing on their wearable NFTs to the next player.\n\nHolistically, ICE Poker\u2019s monetization strategy is analogous to those perfected by high-growing consumer tech companies. The first step is user acquisition, which is where ICE Poker is today. Once users are brought into the product and scale is achieved, activations and secondary sales may potentially become more tangible sources of revenue \u2014 and not just any revenue, but a recurring revenue that yields higher valuations and protocol stability.\n\nGovernance Updates\n\nThe management of the DG lounge is mostly left up to stakers of the DG token. Governance participants can vote on the use of proceeds, whitelist logic, partnerships, gameplay factors (such as point multipliers), and more. The following is a series of approved governance decisions with high protocol impact:\n\nJan. 21, 2022 \u2014 Update ICE Poker Rewards Split to Incentivize Upgrades and Player Ownership\n\nAll delegated NFTs followed the same reward split prior to this governance decision: the delegator would receive 30% of the rewards while the player always earned 70% of the profits. Note this system ignores NFT rank. This governance decision changes that distribution. Voters believed owners should also earn a higher percentage of the reward since they bear the full cost of upgrading the NFT. The new split for wearable delegators will be as follows:\n\nRank 1 \u2014 40%; Rank 2 \u2014 43%; Rank 3 \u2014 46%; Rank 4 \u2014 49%; and Rank 5 (Diamond Hands) \u2014 52%.\n\nFeb. 5, 2022 \u2014 Allow Partnered Metaverse Advertised in ICE Poker Venues\n\nA decision to approve advertisements (images, video, or audio) was made by governance at the beginning of February 2022. Advertisements are to be placed in strategic but non-intrusive locations within a few of the ICE Poker venues. The first location was the Stronghold venue, followed by the implementation of advertisements in the DEXT Lounge and Chateau Satoshi as well. Payment to Decentral Games will be made through stablecoins that will fund token buyback or LP revenue.\n\nFeb. 6, 2022 \u2014 Lower Bars to Post and Pass a Proposal\n\nFaced with high governance participation barriers, staked tokenholders voted to lower bars to post and pass proposals. Following the approved vote, the number of xDG needed to make a proposal fell from 1.9 million xDG to 10,000 xDG, increasing the count from 33 to 185 wallets that were eligible to make proposals. The quorum to approve decisions also fell from 38 million xDG to 10 million xDG, making proposals easier to pass.\n\nMar. 26, 2022 \u2014 Price the Next NFT Drop in ICE Tokens Instead of ETH\n\nIce Poker NFT Drop #8, the one titled ICE Beach Day, was priced in ICE tokens instead of ETH as a result of this governance vote. It was the first NFT drop to do so, and NFT Drop #10 (ICE Poet) was also priced in ICE. Denominating the sale in ICE encourages minters to purchase ICE and gives the protocol the ability to recalibrate token supply. Future mints will also likely be priced in either ETH or ICE.\n\nRoadmap\n\nTo further expand the DG ecosystem, the development team has three core priorities for the upcoming quarter: solidify in-game tokenomics, improve the gameplay of ICE Poker, and launch a mobile-first application for on-the-go accessibility.\n\nSolidify ICE Poker Game Economics\n\nAny successful game design relies on sustainable in-game economics. If designed poorly, games face virtual inflation, which occurs when long-time players accumulate enough in-game capital to make purchases unattainable for new players. This inflation drives new players away from the game and slows the game\u2019s growth.\n\nThis type of inflation is a relevant concern for ICE Poker. Balancing in-game currencies, NFT sales, and new mints necessitate game faucets to ensure that the issuance and burns are well-balanced. While this is an ongoing focus area, some ideas implemented by the team are higher stakes poker competitions, non-ICE NFT wearables, and custom NFT emotes.\n\nScale Gameplay of ICE Poker\n\nHaving previously experimented with various games, Decentral Games found poker to be the standout hit that attracted \u2013 and retained \u2013 users. A continued goal of the Decentral Games team, therefore, is to build out features designed to improve gameplay on ICE Poker.\n\nFor example, the team shipped the Assigned Seating feature which went live on March 31. It was put in place to stop players from choosing their specific seating at an active game. Since positioning is critical for a turn-based game like poker, this new feature reduces collusion opportunities between friendly parties. The development team plans to continue adding or tweaking elements to improve its game.\n\nInaugurate ICE Poker Mobile\n\nA mobile version of ICE Poker is expected to be launched in Q2 2022. The on-the-go gameplay option will allow the team to attract new users and keep existing users engaged. The Decentral Games team has explicitly called this an important milestone to \u201conboard the next 30,000 players into the DG ecosystem.\u201d\n\nBased on public announcements, it seems that ICE Poker Mobile and the browser-based metaverse will share the same in-game currency and rewards mechanisms; however, ICE Poker Mobile will be an abbreviated 2-D version of the game. The result of that decision will be shorter gameplay times, lower entry costs, and smaller in-game rewards.\n\nClosing Summary\n\nIf the metaverse is defined by anything, it\u2019s by a surplus of ideas and a shortage of users. Even on the user front, emerging technologies might find an old adage to hold true: attracting users is easy; retaining users is hard. When people finally choose to explore virtual worlds out of curiosity, will they continue to come back to it, day after day, week after week?\n\nThe main takeaway for Decentral Games\u2019 Q1 is straightforward. It\u2019s still too early to make predictions, but their current ability to draw thousands of daily active users is impressive. A big part of that may be what they\u2019re building (poker has historically been quite successful). Yet with continued design efforts, gameplay improvements, and a mobile app launching next quarter, Decentral Games and their ICE Poker metaverse are set up for continued near-term growth.\n\nThis report was commissioned by Decentral Games, a member of Protocol Services.

The team innovated Protocol Controlled Value, using protocol-owned equity to backstop the algorithmic incentives it had created to manage a stablecoin peg. Because PCV is not debt or seigniorage, there is no risk of a liquidation event or death spiral. The risk lies in the fidelity and volatility of the PCV\u2019s assets, relative to the outstanding liabilities in minted stablecoins. The Fei Protocol PCV consists of decentralized assets and is currently deployed to provide liquidity and earn yield. The \u201ccollateral ratio,\u201d which measures circulating FEI supply to PCV, is a key metric in determining the credibility of the peg. Fei V2 was announced in October 2021, removing the direct incentives mechanism in favor of 1:1 redeemability of FEI for decentralized assets ETH, DAI, and LUSD. The DAO manages the reserve pools that back these mint/redeem mechanisms, currently with a 50 bps spread. As part of V2, the DAO aligned TRIBE (the project governance token) with the stablecoin as seigniorage. TRIBE now benefits from the PCV\u2019s earnings in the form of buybacks, while also playing backstop (seigniorage) if the PCV can\u2019t backstop the existing stablecoin supply. In January 2022, Fei Protocol merged with Rari Capital to form Tribe DAO.\n\n  \n  \n  \n\nQuarterly Discussion\n\nThe State of Fei\nFei-Rari Merger\nFEI stablecoin performance and adoption\nPCV Management\nTribe Token\nLaaS\nRoadmap\n  Turbo\n  xTribe\n  Other Key Announcements\nConcluding Thoughts and Questions\n\nThe State of Fei\n\nFei is a protocol in transition \u2014 both in its utilization and structure, with the creation of Tribe DAO and merger between Fei Protocol and Rari Capital. FEI is a fully functioning stablecoin that is in its own category. Unlike most stablecoins, FEI is certainly not centralized. FEI is not a purely algorithmic stablecoin. Neither is FEI a collateralized stablecoin, as there is no debt or collateral involved. Instead, FEI can be thought of as a reserve-backed stablecoin.\n\nThe team innovated Protocol Controlled Value, which is different from collateral because it is owned and controlled by the DAO. The original design attempted to pair this PCV with an algorithmic design, using direct incentives to manage the peg with the PCV as a backstop. Despite being an innovative design and highly touted project, it did not function as desired. Fortunately, Fei was able to pivot and use 1:1 minting and redeemability of PCV for FEI within a band to maintain the peg, the design it currently uses.\n\nUsing the reserve-backed stablecoin model we can explain the balancing forces for the stablecoin peg. The reserve ratio is the ratio of total PCV relative to total FEI supplied, which includes the circulating supply and the protocol-owned supply. Intuitively, this model holds because the equity value owned by the protocol must be greater than or equal to the value that the protocol has added to the market via FEI. Empirically, it is unclear if this model will hold given the limited data, and likely needs to include an interest rate assumption for completion. In Q1, the reserve ratio dropped below 1 in January. It did correspond with downward pressure on the peg and redemptions of FEI for PCV, though the difficult market environment makes the actual causes unclear.\n\nThe reserve-backed stablecoin framework is also useful for framing Tribe DAO\u2019s future plans. The collateral ratio (PCV relative to circulating FEI) reports how much \u201cdry powder\u201d the protocol has to mint and deploy FEI stablecoins productively. This is the liquidity engine that Fei Protocol created: the DAO can both earn yield on PCV assets while minting FEI against them to create and utilize protocol-owned FEI. The marriage with Rari Capital (and the New Year resolution tweet) clarifies the intentions for protocol-owned FEI: to use the lending platform and liquidity engine to become a liquidity provider for DAOs by offering cheap stablecoin liquidity to Rari lending pools. This is an extremely powerful proposition given the state of the PCV and size/growth potential of the market.\n\nDAO treasuries are currently measured at over $9 billion. As the crypto market matures and grows so should treasuries, giving Tribe DAO the opportunity to grow into an expanding market. With the launch of Turbo in the second quarter and other future products leaked, all pitched as solutions for DAO liquidity and treasury management, the team  showing no shortage of products to utilize existing PCV to be deployed as productive protocol-owned FEI, which should increase value for the DAO.\n\nA fundamental question going forward will be how will the DAO grow the PCV. As discussed above, Tribe DAO plans to use existing PCV to provide DAOs with liquidity. However, there is no roadmap yet for increasing demand to minting new user-owned FEI in exchange for reserve assets. The latter would require increased FEI demand and adoption. The upside, of course, is deeper, more liquid markets and greater adoption for a decentralized stablecoin. It would also mean a larger PCV. The downside is the impact on the collateral and reserve ratios. The products so far announced utilize the PCV by supplying FEI to the market with novel products that should drive returns on PCV, but they do not necessarily create incentives for FEI demand.\n\nThe teams at both Fei Labs and Rari Capital have proven to be proficient and indefatigable in their product innovation, design, and launch (i.e., the devs ship) both individually and now combined under Tribe DAO. Although the current direction of the project is becoming clear, there are still some questions and opportunities in the long term. Currently, the project is well-funded with a strong balance sheet position and new products coming to market.\n\nThe DAO Merger\n\nOn November 16, 2021, Joey Santoro (co-founder of Fei) and Jai Bhavnani (co-founder of Rari) proposed a merger of the two protocols. The final snapshot vote to tie the two was completed in January this year, forming the Tribe DAO. As of March 31, 2022, over 5.7 million RGT (Rari Governance Token), around 47% of the supply, has been exchanged for roughly 152 million TRIBE at an exchange ratio of 1:26.7. RGT holders have until August 1, 2022 at midnight GMT to exchange their tokens at the fixed rate, after which it will essentially become a meme token with no governance rights. The vote also confirmed Fei would be assuming Rari\u2019s outstanding liabilities from a hack in 2021. Fei has paid out over $9.6 million to victims of the hack that totaled slightly over $11.6 million. Although snapshot votes passed with few voting dissent (0 RGT against, 3.9k TRIBE against), the team created a ragequit mechanism for TRIBE holders who disagreed with the decision. About 10% of these holders chose to transfer for a fixed amount of FEI (roughly 1.088/TRIBE).\n\nThe merger was motivated by the synergy team\u2019s saw between the two protocols and fairly equal market caps. Fei has a treasure chest of liquidity via PCV, and Rari has Fuse, a platform to create customizable lending pools. FEI was already the largest asset by total value locked in Fuse pools. If their incentives were aligned under one DAO, the team would be able to take the rails of the two projects to build significantly more powerful products. The existing products, FEI stablecoin and Rari Fuse Pools and Vaults, will continue to operate independently while being governed by Tribe DAO. The focus of their new product launches is to find use cases to marry lending markets with a liquidity engine.\n\nFEI Stablecoin Performance\n\nThe protocol\u2019s primary product lagged behind peers in the first quarter in terms of supply growth, volumes, and velocity (the ratio of volume to supply). The V2 implementation and governance updates thereafter helped the stablecoin maintain its peg within the desired band, piggybacking off the DAI peg with a 1:1 redeemability for DAI via the peg stability mechanism. However, in terms of volatility around the peg, FEI\u2019s peg remains wider than the top five stablecoins.\n\nThe supply numbers for FEI include both circulating FEI and protocol-owned FEI. As market volatility increased in December and January, so did DAI and FEI peg stability. This led to increased redemption of FEI for DAI, primarily from arbs. Simultaneously, PCV declined as ETH fell, putting pressure on the reserve ratio. Fei Protocol enacted contractionary monetary policies on January 23 and January 25 by reducing protocol-owned FEI from the market. For the quarter, circulating FEI supply fell 18%, and protocol-owned FEI dropped by 38%. As of March 31, 59% of FEI supply is on DEXs, led by Uniswap and Curve. Under 12% of supply is on lending platforms, with Rari and Aave the largest holders.\n\nPCV Management\n\nFei\u2019s PCV is predominantly ETH as measured by core assets (including stETH and other ETH lending deposits). It\u2019s entering the quarter at about two-thirds concentration in the asset. Almost the entire remainder is in decentralized stablecoins LUSD, DAI, and RAI, with about a 2% balance spread across native lending and exchange tokens like BAL, COMP, AAVE, TOKE, CREAM, etc., and a 1% position in DPI. As the selloff in markets progressed through December and January, Fei saw a substantial amount of FEI redeemed in exchange for DAI, depleting balances from $125.6 million to $44.7 million by the end of the quarter. The team made monetary changes by reducing the supply of FEI to relieve pressure on the peg. Redemptions have since halted, leaving Fei Protocol with a 75% concentration in ETH as a core asset at the close of the first quarter.\n\nThe PCV shrunk in value by 12.3% in Q1. The primary factors were the circulating FEI redemptions for DAI as well as an 11% fall in ETH price, which was largely offset with a 9% increase in ETH held. The second largest increase in PCV was the introduction of gOHM to the PCV after entering into a partnership with OlympusDAO, building a $2.1 million position. The Tribe DAO controls the allocation of the PCV and was active in the quarter. The biggest changes were repurposing ETH from Compound and a second Balancer pair to Aave. Stablecoins were also released from Compound and the Liquity Stability Pool, a yield-generating pool of assets that liquidate LUSD loans, as the protocol replenished the stablecoin balance after the January Dai drain.\n\nTracking the PCV\u2019s yield generation will reveal the efficacy of the DAO to manage the assets in the PCV. Unfortunately, it is difficult to track revenues produced by allocations currently. As the steward of the PCV, the DAO is incentivized to optimally allocate both PCV assets and protocol-owned FEI. This risk/reward balance should directly impact the value of the TRIBE token.\n\nTRIBE token\n\nWith the launch of Fei V2, TRIBE became more than just a governance token. It assumed the buyer-of-last-resort role to backstop FEI as well as benefit from buybacks from earnings on PCV. Most importantly, however, TRIBE is the governance token for Tribe DAO, managing FEI, Rari Capital, and the PCV. There is an initial maximum supply of 1 billion TRIBE, with 453 million circulating at the end of the first quarter. Because the DAO has discretion to allocate rewards to incentivize liquidity, the token's inflation rate will be dynamic going forward. That said, the core team and investors are subject to a 4-year linear vesting and 5-year back-weighted vesting, respectively. The DAO uses the treasury TRIBE holdings as extra rewards to incentivize users to engage with different Fuse Pools as well as other liquidity investments with their PCV or protocol-owned FEI. To increase the alignment of governance and yield for TRIBE holders, the DAO is planning to release xTribe in Q2.\n\nLiquidity-as-a-Service (LaaS)\n\nIn November 2021, Fei Protocol and Ondo Finance launched Liquidity-as-a-Service (LaaS). LaaS is a debt offering that DAO treasuries can use to increase their project\u2019s liquidity. Historically, liquidity mining is at the cost of equity capital for a treasury, as they need to bootstrap two sides of a liquidity pool as well as incentivize others to do so with token rewards, i.e., equity from the treasury. With LaaS, the DAO only needs to fund one side of the liquidity pool, and FEI will loan them a stablecoin for the other side. The cost of the debt is a fixed percentage paid to Fei Protocol (5% in the first iteration) plus the impermanent loss of the pair, less trading fees earned. At the end of the loan, the DAO pays back Fei Protocol the full senior principal position plus interest, keeping the liquidity fees.\n\nThis offering still has its risks. For Fei, if the DAO token they are loaning against goes down more than 50%, the DAO will have to liquidate other treasury assets to pay back the loan in full. Because this is a debt offering, not equity, Fei might need to secure collateral to the junior assets it is loaning against in the event the borrower\u2019s treasury doesn\u2019t have enough assets to repay.\n\nThe first experiment resulted in both profit and risk, as seen by the bear market ensuing shortly after launch.\n\nResults from the first experiment were profitable but also demonstrative of the nuanced risks, revealed by the bear market that ensued shortly after launch. First of all, there was a lot of appetite from DAOs, proving there is demand for this liquidity product. Fei also learned a lesson on how to approach liquidity and debt offerings. Some holes in the first iteration were no liquidation rules nor collateral controls, leaving Fei in the unintentional position of directional trader. In the coming launch of Turbo and other products, the DAO will benefit from this first Liquidity-as-a-Service innovation and will be able to create new guardrails and frameworks for deploying FEI. There are also more opportunities to launch new LaaS markets in a more structured form.\n\nRoadmap\n\nTurbo\n\nLaunched on April 20, Turbo is the first release from the newly formed Tribe DAO of Rari Capital and Fei Protocol. An interest-free stablecoin-lending facility to DAOs, Turbo takes whitelisted DAO treasury assets (native tokens) as collateral in exchange for a zero-interest loan on FEI, as long as the FEI is allocated to a yield-generating strategy. The appeal to DAOs is a liquidity boost to their lending pools.\n\nFor example, if ABC DAO was whitelisted (certain liquidity and historical volatility metrics need to be met) by Tribe DAO for Turbo, then ABC could borrow FEI for zero interest against an equal value of ABC collateral as long as it will add the FEI to a yield generating strategy like a Fuse pool. Adding a stablecoin to a Fuse Pool increases liquidity in the pool in two ways: first, by increasing total size, meaning more can be loaned at a lower utilization rate, and second, by adding an asset that can be borrowed using the treasury asset allocated as collateral. For ABC DAO, ABC tokenholders would be able to lend their assets to the pool and borrow FEI against that collateral. The DAO receives interest and fees on those assets \u2014 a productive use for previously stagnant treasury assets - and Tribe DAO also takes a cut of those fees, adding to its PCV.\n\nFor Tribe DAO, Turbo is a way to monetize its PCV. As discussed earlier, Tribe DAO should seek to manage FEI monetary policy and keep total FEI supplied below the PCV. However, while the reserve ratio mentioned above remains above 1, Tribe DAO can use its ability to mint FEI as a productive use of capital to generate fees, essentially borrowing against its PCV to mint and loan out FEI. This dynamic demonstrates how the liquidity engine of Fei Protocol (i.e., the ability to maintain a stablecoin and attract assets for PCV) paired with the lending platform of Fuse can create productive capital.\n\nxTribe\n\nThe Tribe token continues to evolve along with the Tribe DAO. At inception, TRIBE was the governance token for the Fei Protocol managing the FEI peg and PCV allocations. After the transition to V2, TRIBE became a seigniorage token as well, benefiting from yield in PCV in the form of buybacks while taking on risk as the backstop for FEI.\n\nAs the Fei-Rari partnership grew, Fei voted to increase TRIBE rewards for lending TRIBE into Fuse pools, which only increased post-merger. As a result, over 10% of circulating TRIBE was locked in Fuse Pool 8 (184 million as of March 31, 2022) to optimize rewards, which inhibited those holders from participating in governance. On March 22, Joey introduced xTribe, an ERC-4626-compatible token, to align governance and yield-seeking incentives.\n\nExisting TRIBE locked in Fuse Pool 8 and existing RGT locked in Fuse pool 6 and 7 will be automatically upgraded, while future TRIBE staked in yield-generating strategies can receive xTribe for their TRIBE. The new token will offer auto-compounding for holders, the ability to participate in governance with multi-delegation capabilities, and the ability to be used as collateral in Turbo with the largest revenue share out of any token. xTribe is expecting a code audit this April and then will be waiting on a DAO vote.\n\nAn interesting dynamic will be the rewards direction that is empowered by xTRIBE. Like the Curve Wars model where stakers get to vote on rewards direction, xTRIBE will give stakers a vote that can direct TRIBE rewards in Fuse pools. So if xTRIBE stakers want to direct more TRIBE rewards to any specific pool or asset, they could do so. From a DAO liquidity standpoint, this means users can further incentivize liquidity in their token in the lending pools by directing rewards towards it.  \n\nOther Q1 Proposals and Changes\n\nJanuary 25, 2021 \u2014 Upgrade Dai Redeemability\n\nThe team discussed methods to tighten the peg given its underperformance in terms of volatility around the peg compared to other large DeFi stablecoins. The proposal was to tighten the FEI peg to DAI in the PSM. Coincident to the early January volatility and loss of DAI from the PCV via redemptions, the team decided to also remove mint fees from the DAI PSM in order to incentivize rebuilding DAI balances in the PCV. The tighter peg and incentives have helped reduce volatility around the peg and increase DAI in the PCV.\n\nFebruary 10, 2021 \u2014 Governance Enhancements\n\nNew governance enhancements proposed using Liquid Representative Democracy. According to Joey\u2019s post,\n\n\u201cLiquid Representative Democracy means that a committee is elected by the DAO to operate the Optimistic Timelock with discretion. The DAO can at any time change the composition of the committee by adding or removing signers. This opens up more opportunities for the most committed community members to play an elevated role in governance.\u201d\n\nThe committee will be the Tribe Council, operating a 5-of-9 multisig and made up of community, Fei core, and Rari infrastructure members. No group can individually reach a quorum. To balance the greater powers given to the Council, there will be a 4-day time lock on decisions as well as greater veto powers given to Tribe DAO (1-day time lock), Guardian (immediate execution), and Nope DAO (immediate execution). This is a novel structure using Orca Pods and optimizing for speed in the product suite with protection for the DAO as a whole. The structure will likely require greater transparency on actions and proposals for negative consent from the DAO.\n\nMarch 21, 2021 \u2014 PCV Sentinel\n\nDAO passed a vote to create the PCV Sentinel, giving the ability to create automatic guards to the DAO Guardian wallet. The Guardian wallet can pause or unpause any operations related to the PCV. A guard in the Sentinel is a smart contract capable of pausing PCV operations if a trigger is hit, empowering the team to have automatic fail safes on the PCV to protect assets.\n\nMarch 24, 2021 \u2014 Volt joins the TRIBE\n\nVOLT is a CPI-pegged stablecoin backed by a combination of user-deposited assets and PCV, incubated by Tribe DAO. With this proposal, the Tribe DAO agreed to a token swap, assuming control of 30% of VOLT and a 10 million FEI backstop for VOLT at launch.\u00a0\n\nConclusion\n\nFei Protocol and the emerging Tribe DAO are in a strong position but lacking momentum. FEI usage has declined while other stablecoins are increasing adoption. The PCV is well-backed, the liquidity engine is stable, and the lending platform is running well. New product launches should offer an exciting use case and proof of concept for the combined team. The individuals involved in the project are highly capable and have proven their ability to learn, iterate, and build. Execution and product market fit for the new launches has yet to be proven, but the building blocks are well-made and in place.\n\nThis report was commissioned by Tribe Grants, a member of Protocol Services.

It's official! So yeah, thanks everyone for joining us on this Compound quarterly analyst call. I just want to let everyone know, if you guys have any questions feel free to drop them and we'll try to address those towards the end of the call. Quick introduction, my name is Sean. We have Sami here, and we're both research analysts at Messari. We're here today with Getty Hill from GFX Labs. Very kind of him to be joining us here again today so thank you for that. If you want to just give a brief introduction of who you are, what's GFX Labs about and kind of how you guys fit into the puzzle of Compound.\n\nGetty Hill (00:49): Yeah sure thing, thanks for having me here. I'm glad to be invited back for a second time to go through the numbers here on Compound over the last quarter. So myself and GFX Labs have been involved in Compound now for definitely at least two years, solidly. We're responsible for a lot of the fun governance stuff in the protocol, and one of the general movers and shakers on there as well. Definitely check out the other work that we're doing in general in the space. We have Poppy, which is a neat crypto credit card product that we're developing and the game Etherlands, but we love to dabble in DeFi and governance wholeheartedly as well. So you can see our work on Compound by checking out the forum over there or on Uniswap and whatnot as well. We're in all places for the most part, we really enjoy participating in DeFi and the wild space of crypto.\n\nSean Butterfield (01:41): Awesome, yeah thanks for that overview. So yeah, basically the focus of this call today is really to kind of dig into some on-chain data, get a better understanding of what happened over the quarter and identify any changes in KPIs, some key changes to the protocol, and overall market trends. So, before going into that I just want to give everyone, maybe some new viewers, a quick recap of what Compound is. A leading decentralized interest rate protocol, serving as a marketplace for lenders and borrowers of various assets. Before digging into the macro, I kind of want to give a quick crypto market backdrop. Generally the overall crypto market in Q4 hit all-time highs, which largely drove a lot of the activity in the previous quarter. As we rolled into Q1 we saw some volatility, shaving $1.4 trillion off the peak back in Q4 to around $1.6 trillion in Q1. Revisiting those 12 month lows that we saw back in july of 2021. I think as we understand that a little better it'll kind of help drive and appreciate the narrative of the overall Compound sentiment over the last quarter. It appears leverage increases as the markets experience bull cycles. So, as we mentioned, the market cooled down in Q1, and that's a really good segue into going over some of these macro metrics for Compound. I'm going to share my screen here so bear with me. Are we all good here? Awesome. So yeah, you'll see outstanding loans and deposits are really the driving factors of Compound. As you can see we saw a pretty substantial decrease across all indicators here. We saw about a 42% decrease in outstanding loans. Coming from about $6 billion to about $3.5 billion. Largely driven by the borrower appetite, the demand for leverage decreasing in Q1, and going down. Outstanding deposits dropped about 32% coming from $14 billion to just shy of $10 billion. Originations also took a pretty big hit, just over 50%, going from $11 billion to just under $6 billion. Subsequently, deposits also were down about 80%, a pretty nasty metric there. We saw $63 billion last quarter drop to about $13 billion and change this quarter. Really the only metrics that saw any light were liquidations, but at the same time probably not favorable for most of the users of the protocol. We saw about a 300% increase in liquidations from about $34 million to $134 million. I think that was mostly driven by the wETH markets on Compound. Digging a little deeper into the net interest, income, or the financial I should say. Total interest income was slashed by about 50% from $90 million in Q4 to just under $42 million. As the loan demand decreased, depositor demand decreased which ultimately decreased interest expense from about $80 million to about $37 million giving us just shy of $5 million on that interest income. Q1 there was a pause in the grants program so there weren't any grants paid so we really just have an unchanged net income amount of $4.8 million. Going a little further down we have the token incentives paid. Similarly as the loans outstanding and the deposits outstanding decline, we'll definitely see a decline across the token incentives being paid. So that fell from $55 million to about $26 million over the quarter. Giving us an adjusted net income improvement of about 53%, ending negative $22 million in the quarter. That was a lot of data thrown at you so I hope you were able to digest some of that. I wanted to ask you Getty, if you have any overall broad input on those changes over the quarter?\n\nGetty Hill (07:06): Yeah, I think it definitely wasn't by any means a strong quarter for Compound. I think similar though, it was a tough one in general for many platforms in DeFi so it's not exactly Compound acting as an anomaly in this instance. I think generally speaking some of the key external inputs in the space, there are strong indicators to what the health of the ecosystem has kind of shown over the last quarter or so. Definitely slow, I mean, I noticed the other day that Tether had its last print on April 3rd and in February, late February was the last USDC mint. So things that for the most part in Q4 and certainly in Q3 were just chugging along printing huge amounts of new dollars and value into the space have substantially contracted. So I think those are interesting indicators to say okay, maybe there's some external reason behind the shrinking growth in the platform over the last quarter. I do want to highlight one of the most important line items on this page here is aggregate utilization. After all, the protocol's job is to take in assets that folks lend the protocol, and then lend assets out to borrowers and that's a key stat to me on here. It's a bit hard to say when you see outstanding loans in terms of a dollar value adjusting because there's all these coin prices and whatnot. Aggregate utilization is an important one because of that. So it's disappointing to see that it is down, but when compared to some of those other stats that are showing 41% shrink in outstanding loans, and the 32% shrink in deposits, I think it becomes a lot easier to stomach. When you understand the general bread and butter of the protocol here, sure it shrunk, but it really shrunk by less than 6% over the last quarter and that's that's the key component for me.\n\nSean Butterfield (09:09): Yeah great, thank you for that input. Sami did you have anything?\n\nSami Kassab (09:14): No, I think Getty just made a good point related to how a lot of the decreases aren't a direct relation to specifically Compound, it's mainly related to the general financial market that we're seeing going on in the crypto space. We had general market conditions trading sideways and so a lack of users looking for leverage is essentially going to lead to a lack of borrowing activity. Pretty straightforward here.\n\nSean Butterfield (09:50): Getty, quick question, you know I feel like these metrics are pretty easy to follow, is there anything outside of this that you typically look at and maybe does it change as the overall market sentiment changes? Whether we're in more of a bull cycle or more of a bear cycle, are there different indicators that you're keeping track of?\n\nGetty Hill (10:13): I think there's some specific users that you can look at that demonstrate a good wind vane essentially for the flow funds in the space. If you look at some of these monster accounts, I mean especially if you want to figure out who the big users are on the platform and track what they're doing and say hey, these guys are sophisticated. They're on AAVE, they're on MakerDAO, they're on Compound, they're on all the money markets. They're even on cross-chain platforms. Where are they putting their capital? How is their capital flowing? Those users are the ones I tend to look at when we want to get a bit more of a specific sample as to what's happening. One of the reasons why Compound is what it is today is that there are a lot of users who used it once upon a time, a year ago, two years ago, and just never left. That makes it a little harder to look at the whole picture and get a macro sense of what exists here and what's actually occurring in the trend. If you look at some of those particular target users who have a few hundred million dollar position on Compound but also on AAVE and also on MakerDAO, they paint a better picture of exactly why users are flowing capital from point A to B. Is it because MakerDAO is reducing their interest rates and providing a more capital efficient opportunity for those users? Is it because AAVE is offering some new assets that have a collective better overall margin opportunity for those users? Those are the details that you can't necessarily encompass in a macro overview like this that can paint a bit more of a precise picture.\n\nSean Butterfield (11:48): Yeah I totally agree with that comment, and yeah we might high level touch on something similar to what you're saying as it relates to the more sophisticated deeper liquidity folks who are participating on the platform. So, moving along, Sami, I'll let you take over here. We're going to go over some of the charts as it relates to these outstanding loans and deposits and I'll let you take care of that Sami.\n\nSami Kassab (12:24): I appreciate that. So, starting off here with the outstanding loans. In general we saw outstanding loans declined by roughly 42% like Sean was saying. These levels are going back to what we saw around July of 2021 and again like we discussed, this is mainly related to market conditions trading very choppy for the past quarter. We really haven't seen any new highs like we saw in Q4. Just a lot of volatility up and down which is what you see in a sideways trading market. The biggest contributors that we have to outstanding loans are obviously the stable coins and that's where we saw the biggest decrease. We had DAI which decreased roughly 47% this quarter and USDC decreased roughly 41% this quarter as far as outstanding loans. Now, if we go to the next chart here we can take a look at the borrower interest rates. In general, last quarter these rates were averaging at about 5% in Q4. For this quarter, Q1, we saw rates averaging about 3.8%. A pretty substantial drop in borrower interest rates. One thing I found that was interesting is ever since Q3 you're kind of seeing a minimization of volatility in general for borrower interest rates and that's kind of excluding what we saw in October and November of 2021. We saw the volatility there take up mainly around when the market was peaking as far as the general market cap. One thing I wanted to ask you about Getty, the majority of borrowing demand on Compound we know is originating from people looking for leverage and also people seeking out yield farming opportunities. That's really because DeFi in its state right now is more of a circular economy. It doesn't really feed into too many real world applications. I was curious if you had any views on where you saw future new demand, new borrowing demand, originating from? Do you have any thoughts on that?\n\nGetty Hill (15:01): Yeah, I think in the immediate future there are a number of collateral assets the platform is looking to support and I think those will be the most immediate things to drive our demand. Particularly something that GFX Labs has been working on is getting MATIC added to the platform, Polygon\u2019s native currency. I think there's a huge amount of interest in getting that supported and on somewhere on mainnet because currently it's not actually available to borrow against anywhere on mainnet, in size at least. I think that's on the immediate forefront, and then from there I think the longer term view looks like the industry is still extremely nascent in the whole sense. I don't think necessarily external motives from the traditional world are going to be influencing the platform anytime soon. I do think as we look to expand beyond basic ERC-20\u00a0 tokens as collateral and some more sophisticated positions, new opportunities will rise to the platform. People have been talking about getting stETH added to the platform which has been quite popular. Other versions of staked ETH also, and then from there other derivatives like some of these AMM LP tokens and whatnot that you can safely assign collateral values to. It's a matter of time, and building out the infrastructure for those components, but I think that's what will be drawing borrowers in over the long-term.\n\nSami Kassab (16:18): Yeah, that makes sense. Then when we think longer term as well, once Compound goes multi-chain that'll definitely bring new borrowing activity as well onto the protocol.\n\nGetty Hill (16:31): Yeah absolutely, those new chains will be really important. It\u2019s something that AAVE has done massively well on is succeeding in onboarding new assets on those chains and it\u2019s something we have to play catch up on at this point.\n\nSami Kassab (16:46): Yeah so another question I wanted to bounce your way is related to recursive borrowing. For the viewers here that don't know what that is, can you kind of give an overview of what recursive borrowing is and then also provide your view on whether that has a positive impact on the protocol or if it's more of a negative or frowned upon impact?\n\nGetty Hill (17:10): Sure thing. So there's two particular users on Compound right. There are users who supply capital because they're interested in borrowing some other assets. So they supply one coin and borrow a different coin. Then there are the other users who just supply capital to the protocol in an interest to earn yield. Now within those there's a sub category of users who just traditionally supply whatever given asset to the protocol, and then there are these recursive participants. So some just supply, some put on this bit more sophisticated strategy where you will borrow, or you do this positive collateral. Say DAI for example here, you have 100,000 DAI. Then you can go and borrow up to your maximum whatever the collateral factor is against DAI on the market and borrow the maximum of it. You now take everything you just borrowed, you deposit it back into the protocol, and you repeat this process over and again to get that recursiveness. Essentially, what it does is it amplifies your dollar notional position on the platform while maintaining the same amount of capital that you're invested into the position. Why people do this is because at times we're incentivizing participation in the protocol through COMP rewards. COMP is getting paid to the pro rata share of participants on the supply side and then the pro rata participation on the borrower's side. So users can amplify their pro rata participation in this pool by doing this recursive kind of setup here. I think that's the quick overview of what it is. This has been going on for coming up on two years, you know? But yeah, it's been going on for a long time. There has been some recent debate about how sustainable? How important are these for the platform? What do they actually mean for the platform? All that is happening here from a purely stats standpoint is the user is depositing capital and the interest rates will largely remain unchanged and the utilization of the protocol remains unchanged. Regardless of if this user is a traditional supplier of the protocol and just lending that capital, or recursively borrowing it. The amount of capital getting deposited is the same and it doesn't affect the change in utilization because they're just perfectly looping it through. So, in general the only change in the protocol is changing TVL a little bit, changing interest rates a little bit. It doesn't really provide significant capital to the protocol by any means beyond just a general supply. Essentially these things function identical to what a normal lender would do to the protocol, the only difference is that they're amplifying these stats because there are some other reasons to make the stats bigger. But for the most part they just function like any other loan to the protocol.\n\nSean Butterfield (19:58): Gotcha, so it sounds like it's not adding any additional risk to the protocol and so essentially they're just farming out these COMP rewards. If we ended up seeing in the future at some point these COMP rewards being removed from the market would you essentially see these recursive borrowers leave as well?\n\nGetty Hill (20:22): I don't think they would necessarily leave, but I definitely think there would be a decrease. Essentially what's happening right now is the protocol is subsidizing rates. Just to make up a number, if the protocol is paying out 3% interest rates and the COMP rewards add an additional 25 or 50 bps to the protocol, hey that's 25 or 50 bps. In theory if we pull those out then some capital should drift away from the protocol to better opportunities. But the core premise that folks need to remember is that these guys are looping because they're interested in getting the best interest rate available. Their job is to make money ultimately and so if we decrease our rates further by removing this extra incentive but we remain to be the best option for their capital, their capital will stay. So I don't think we would lose 100%\u00a0 of capital that's relying on these rates because at the same time, the general problem exists at AAVE as well and at any of their alternatives to where they can stick their capital. At this point the rates have been on a solid trend down since the very day they started, but particularly in the last half a year or so. You could look back to even five or six months ago, or at the very beginning of the year. You could still earn 12% doing a recursive loan on DAI which most viewed to be a very safe, stable rate to be earning capital and today it's substantially less than that. I think we've already seen a solid progression of those rewards decreasing and of that participation decreasing along with it.\n\nSami Kassab (21:56): Perfect, I really appreciate you breaking that down. So let's go ahead and move on to the next slide where we'll talk a little bit about outstanding deposits in general. Wrapped Ethereum continues to maintain its dominance, it's the largest deposited asset on the protocol. This quarter we saw DAI and USDC kind of neck and neck competing for that second largest deposit, they're very close as far as actual dollar amounts. The interesting thing is that we saw DAI\u2019s outstanding deposits decreased nearly 50% and then if we look at deposit volume for DAI in the quarter that was down 90%. Sean was actually pretty curious about why this DAI deposit volume had decreased so much, so he worked with one of our data scientists here and they were looking at the on-chain metrics and it was suggesting mainly that there were a few market makers that were basically arbitraging between AAVE and Compound. Like you said, looking for the best interest rates. It seems like they closed out some pretty large positions in Q1 and that goes back to what you were saying in the beginning. Looking at the macro doesn't really tell you the whole story. Looking at some of these whales and some of these users of the protocol also gives you additional insight for what's going on on the protocol. One thing that got me curious as well, last quarter we saw Coinbase\u2019s DeFi yield integration. Essentially, if you had DAI they would pay you an interest rate and they were taking that DAI and then inserting into Compound. Last quarter we saw a large inflow of DAI and it seems that this quarter we saw a 50% reduction so it makes me think did we get a little bump in outstanding deposits from that integration that long-term wasn't really sustainable, it just depleted slowly. It makes me think because the protocol has MakerDAO\u2019s direct deposit module coming up which is essentially going to do something similar. So, I just kind of wanted to get your view on, do you think these integrations with different products have a long-term effect on the protocol? Or is it sometimes short-term?\n\nGetty Hill (24:32): Yeah I think it's tough to say. We don't really have a long history or really any history of protocol integrations materially changing the landscape of what the platform looks like. I'm really excited for the D3M module though, MakerDAO\u2019s direct to buy deposit module, to come about. I think that's a really efficient way for the protocol to get capital and also to symbiotically work with MakerDAO in an uncompetitive environment where everyone wins. So I'm very much looking forward to that. I do think that though it's a bit hard to say what it all looks like. There's a strict balance in my mind as a bit more of a traditional DeFi person, that protocol integrations are great as long as you don't add on too much systemic risk to the space. Because ultimately some of the games that folks are playing with Compound and say well, Compound is in a great position to succeed if AAVE explodes one day, god forbid it ever happens and vice versa. So everyone needs to make sure we also don't stack on too much systemic risk in the space which could lead to the demise if something truly awful were to happen.\n\nSami Kassab (25:40): Moving on to depositor interest rates, in general we saw rates decrease as borrowing demand declined over the last quarter. Q4 we had the average rate for depositing be around 2%, this quarter it\u2019s around 1.5% on average. One thing interesting to note is that we are seeing the normal depositor interest rate, and the depositor interest rate with incentives, start to converge. Not only for depositing, but for borrowers. This is partially attributed to COMP basically halving COMP rewards, and I'm sure we'll talk about that quite a bit in later on, so I'll just kind of mention that for now. But, related to all these new integrations I have another question for you. Do you see the source, the main source of deposits on Compound in the future coming from professional liquidity providers? Whether it's funds, VCs, institutions, is that what the protocol is targeting rather than the normal DeFi user? This might be a general DeFi question, are these protocols starting to focus more on institutions that have more deep liquidity rather than the person who's yield farming in their mom's basement?\n\nGetty Hill (27:19): I think we need to keep in mind when we're talking about depositor rates, we're largely thinking about the stable coins on the protocol. DAI, USDC, Tether, and I think largely speaking, the folks who are leaning on those markets the most, representing the largest portion of those markets, are institutional players or players with extreme high net worths who are looking to park dollars for safe steady rates for a long period of time. I know for certain that some of the larger participants in the borrow/lend ecosystem in crypto, like the BlockFis, the Celsius, or the Nexos of the space, certainly look at general dollar rates. The primary stack historically in crypto for dollar rates has been the funding on the Bitcoin perp. But certainly DeFi dollar rates are creeping into the methodology as well as like hey, how much do my dollars earn and where can I put them? We're slowly developing a bit of our own DeFi based LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate) across all the ecosystems.\n\nSami Kassab (28:23): Yeah that makes sense. Thanks for breaking that down. Last slide I'll be covering right now is going to be the utilization ratio. If we can go to that slide, Sean? This slide basically summarizes what we've been saying. Basically the outstanding borrows have decreased in relation to outstanding deposits. The only interesting thing I can comment about this is that historically we've seen 40% almost serve as sort of a support level and we haven't seen that rate drop below 40% for a significant period of time. But Q1 we have seen it fall below 40% for an extended period of time. I think that pretty much wraps it up here, I'll pass it back to you, Sean, to take over the next few slides.\n\nSean Butterfield (29:35): Cool, thank you. So we kind of touched base on this a little bit earlier in that macro table as it relates to interest income. Obviously as you can see there's a substantial decrease quarter over quarter. I think it was about a 53% decline from $90 million to $42 million in interest. It's directly correlated with the overall demand for loans, repayment on those loans, interest that essentially flows through the protocol. One thing I wanted to mention is looking at the data, it looks like USDC actually led the way in the deterioration and interest income. It accounts for about 62% decline with USDT and wBTC fighting for second in interest income deterioration with 50.8% and 50.7% respectively. Moving on to protocol income, the narrative is very much the same across the board outside of liquidations. Protocol income, same thing, was halved in Q1 a little over 50% and the same thing, USDC led that reduction in income. I'd be curious Getty, I know there have been previous conversations related to improvement in protocol income. How important is it to the overall Compound protocol and community at large? Instead of me talking about some of these points I'd be interested in hearing some high level remarks about what could contribute to the improvement of protocol revenue, and maybe how far we might be away from some of those implementations?\n\nGetty Hill (31:32): Yeah so I think I'll preface it with let's keep in mind Compound\u2019s governance has been around for less than a year and a half at this point so everyone's still learning what\u2019s the best way to organize and everything. That being said, the reserve factor is what determines how much the protocol takes from interest paid by borrowers before it reaches the lenders. That number is a set parameter on every single market on the platform. Generally speaking, stable coins have a much lower one, altcoins have a much higher one. Particularly when we're talking about the big income earners for the protocol we're thinking about DAI, USDC, Tether. Now, USDC and Tether both have a 7% reserve factor which means we get 7% of interest paid from the borrowers there. Whereas DAI notably has 15% which means, I think the thought was this thing's a bit more volatile so we'll take a bit more when it was originally set. That being said, back to my original governance comment here, the protocol hasn't really done much to play around with these or do any type of research really about should we be choosing a higher or lower number and so we have rather limited data to actually say what we should be doing. The protocol needs to get in a spot where we're willing to experiment a bit more with those rates to actually understand how income can be optimized for the protocol and take those revenues to something a bit more sustainable than what we're currently at today. So it's a bit of a complex problem that generally needs a bit more time and testing before we really speak to it. Hopefully that's something we get to start doing here in the near future.\n\nSean Butterfield (33:13): Sure, recently I was scouring the forums and it looks like there's been mention of building out an asset onboarding framework as it relates to why we should onboard a specific asset. I understand demand would be a very critical factor in that but maybe if you can kind of touch base on any input you might have on that and how you think that would move forward?\n\nGetty Hill (31:32): Yeah, that's a bit of a long point so I'll try to keep it brief here so that I don\u2019t brick the rest of the deck here that I know we have. But you know, when it comes to listing assets you really have to think about it in a few different categories, or at least the few different points you need to assess. One is the general interest from folks who would be supplying that as collateral and folks interested in actually borrowing this collateral. One of those two things needs to be substantially true for the protocol to even really assess it. From there it becomes the security risk and understanding that. A lot of the assets that folks are interested in adding to the platform right now, other than MATIC, are FRAX, LUSD and RAI which generally speaking are a bit outside the normal range of where the protocol operates. Especially in part of the complexity and risk spectrum when it comes to asset listings. So it's a delicate balance of we want to add things to the protocol that users are interested in and want, but we don't want to stack on too much protocol risk. Because, not to be dramatic, but if we list an asset and we give it a collateral factor and it has some type of error in it, the classic example is the infamint, then all the funds in the protocol can be drained if that thing has like infinite, you know has any collateral factor greater than zero. So, the protocol tends to be quite conservative with listing new assets especially because when you look at the stats as we are here, wBTC, ETH, DAI, USDC, the protocol would be not too different if we didn't have any of these other assets in the protocol and we wouldn't be going through this spreadsheet if you just imagine we only have those four coins. It would be largely the same stuff to be talking about so you really have to be careful about the marginal improvement by adding a new asset.\n\nSean Butterfield (35:30): Yeah, that's great. Sami, I don't know if you had any questions or input on that?\n\nSami Kassab (35:38): I just think that's a great point that's getting made. It's really just stables that have the majority of borrowing demand and it kind of goes back to the multi-chain approach that is being talked about. Just having one collateral asset or one deposit asset I believe which is just going to be USDC, right? We'll be talking more about that multi-chain approach as we get towards the end of this slide deck.\n\nSean Butterfield (36:09): So yeah, I'll pass it back to you Sami as it relates to liquidations.\n\nSami Kassab (36:15): Yeah, so like you pointed out Sean, in the beginning. Liquidations was one of the only metrics that kind of had a good quarter. We saw a substantial increase in liquidations. Question to toss your way Getty, can you give some thoughts on liquidation revenues importance to the protocol? Do we see this as healthy revenue?\n\nGetty Hill (36:38): I think this is a newer thing, so it's not recent but I think in mid-2021 we changed the liquidation system to split part of the liquidator incentive. So historically there's been about 7% or 8% that was distributed to the liquidator and then the protocol was like we're going to keep three of that for ourselves and we're going to give five of that to the liquidator. Now this is something similar to what MakerDAO does. They get some revenue from liquidations as well as I believe AAVE, but I could be wrong on that one. So you know it's a weird one, my personal opinion is that protocols shouldn't be incentivized to have liquidations. The inverse of that opinion to play devil's advocate quickly, is just simply that well the protocol is taking out risk here you should be similarly compensated for that loan. My opinion is that risk comes in the factor of the interest rate and that reserve factor we were talking about before. But yeah, I think it's a good thing to be experimenting with especially we all have to remember, as I get stuck in the trenches of DeFi quite often, that really we've only been around for two years so there's a lot to be learned and experimented with.\n\nSami Kassab (37:49): Yeah, exactly. So, moving on to the next slide here we're going to have a chart on token incentives paid. I guess this is where we can talk a little bit about some of these governance proposals that have been passed. So, one of the most critical or major governance proposals that we saw passed this quarter was proposal 92, which basically reduced COMP rewards paid out by 50%. This seemed to be a pretty heated discussion as far as in the forums. There seemed to be people on both sides and I guess the plan was to kind of slowly step down to zero rewards. I think proposal 100 aimed to do that but recently, I believe two days ago, we saw proposal 100 fail. So, what is the plan? I know the community has to really talk about this but as of right now we're just kind of sitting at 50% rewards, right? Is there a plan that the community is talking about? Is there a reason why this first proposal went through and now all of a sudden it seems like the community might have changed their mind? Because I believe it was outlined how initially you guys were going to step down to 50% and then eventually to zero. So can you talk a little bit through maybe both sides of the argument related to removing rewards versus keeping them?\n\nGetty Hill (39:39): So, first I want to set the stage a bit and say when we think about rewards and how they're distributed to users of the protocol we need to think about them in token terms and in dollar terms. Now ultimately we're assuming that the folks who are interested in these rewards the most are here for the financial incentives, that these guys are running and interested in money. So ultimately for their experience, all they care about is the dollar notional value of these tokens that are coming to them. From the protocols perspective, we probably care about the dollar notional value of those tokens but we also care about the general number of tokens as we're essentially entering new tokens into the supply, the circulating supply, and diluting all the existing COMP holders. So it's a bit of a difference there that I want to highlight. If we look over the last year or so, certainly in the last eight months, as COMP prices declined with generally the rest of the DeFi ecosystem. Those dollar notional rewards or distributed users have kind of declined itself. From the people who are interested in using the protocol's perspective rewards have already been cut, right? The inverse of that would be for us to maintain a dollar value and increase the notional amount of COMP we're distributing to maintain the actual dollar notional rewards that they're achieving, but that's not the case. So from their perspective, hey these things have already been going down for a while and you know, that's what they're used to and we already have a lot of data to support what those users are going to be doing as those rates decrease across not only Compound, but the blanket of DeFi. Now particularly with the most recent and 92 and 100 proposals, I think everyone is on the same page that these rewards aren't sustainable for the most part. I shouldn't say everyone but there's certainly some agreement around that these aren't sustainable. Things need to be reformed, and I think that's why 92 is a bit more easy to stomach. It was just a general, we're going to cut these in half. It was quite clearly cited in 92 that there was going to be a proposal 100 that was going to cut them to zero. I think folks largely either didn't read that or were just like, all right well we'll deal with that problem when we get to it. So 92 was rather not controversial. For the most part folks kind of just voted and supported it, it seemed pretty straightforward. The folks who I think represent the protocol most, happily understand that it was a good decision. Then 100 ended up being extremely controversial. I mean I haven't gone through the data because there are a hundred proposals at this point to go through, but I think it is the most controversial governance proposal that has occured on Compound, and certainly one of the most controversial ones in DeFi in general. In the sense that we had, for our protocol, very good voter turnout, about half a million on each side and it came down to 7,000 votes. Which really when you go down the list of people who are set up to vote in the protocol it was a pretty good population of folks who actually turned out to vote. There's a number of people who I was disappointed not to see but it was relatively good. Disappointing outcome from my perspective because I really think rewards at this point are doing very little to support the system and largely just hurting existing COMP holders like myself, but you know that's that's the plight of governance.\n\nSami Kassab (42:55): Yeah, I think it's really interesting how basically depending on how you interact with the protocol leads to how you would view this decision, right? So if you're a big whale that would be using this protocol, obviously it's not in your incentives to want some of these rewards to be removed. But, if you are a VC, or a contributor, or just simply a holder, it's in your best interest to have these rewards eventually go to zero. Because you're not getting crowded out anymore, you're not getting devalued essentially. So it's really interesting to see everybody in the community put their opinion in like you said. I mean the forum post was just popping with everybody, I think it was the one i've seen with the most comments. Like you said, that 7,000 vote delta was extremely close. Anything to add to that, Sean?\n\nSean Butterfield (44:03): Not a whole lot, but as an observer, I'm not a participant of the protocol, it makes a lot of sense from a sustainability point of view. Plenty of mercenary capital that's soaking up all the rewards, dumping the tokens, applying sell side pressure on the COMP token price. It makes sense that this isn't sustainable long-term and making those steps, strategic steps, to try to keep everyone on the same page, keep everyone happy, but also maintain the health of the protocol. Definitely in agreement with the conversation there.\n\nGetty Hill (44:44): I'll add a quick tidbit there, so while this proposal was going on, I was doing some quick research to figure out how many of these COMP rewards are roughly going to folks who are just immediately selling the token. What are these recursive participants doing? Because generally those are the folks who are doing it, and what are they immediately doing et cetera. If you just look at the top 10 suppliers of USDC to the protocol, the top 10 suppliers of DAI to the protocol, and you only look at those accounts. DAI and USDC alone account for over 77% of total COMP rewards distributed in the program. So largely those two alone account for pretty much everything. Then from there you can look at these users and see what their activity is and what they're doing. You're going to count right there between all of them that they represent these recursive users who are just here simply with mercenary capital, which is fine, I'm totally fine with that. They get the COMP, and then just immediately sell the COMP. That accounts for about 41% of the COMP rewards getting distributed and that's just the sample of the top 10 users on those two markets alone. I was trying to get some quick data in like 30 minutes together and that's what I quickly found. I was like well if it's 41% with just this set, the number is definitely a fair bit higher. All we're getting out of this is a little more capital in the protocol and a higher TVL number and you know, for what? To continue diluting all the existing holders and accepting kind of mediocrity on this program. To me it's a pretty black and white issue that I did not expect to be so controversial in proposal 100.\n\nSean Butterfield (46:29): Yeah, you bring up a lot of good points and it's not that we don't want participants on Compound but we also need to kind of create a healthy floor and stabilize the overall protocol so kind of shaking out some of the mercenary capital by removing some of those incentives makes sense.\n\nGetty Hill (46:51): Yeah I mean we have a great user base. You guys have the data here to show that there is billions of dollars of regular, natural usage of the protocol. Folks who are supplying ETH and wrapped Bitcoin, and borrowing dollars for the core example of leverage on their assets. This program that we have here to distribute incentives, best case is adding like $1.5 billion, really best case is adding $1.5 billion. Most likely it\u2019s adding somewhere between about $650 million, $800 million to the protocol. It's not significant to the actual day-to-day operations of the protocol or fundamentally changing anything about the protocol. It's really just in my mind a leach on the protocol at this point. Compound existed well before the COMP incentives ever existed and proved that it had a natural use case in the market, and the data still supports that it does today. So can we get rid of this thing already please?\n\nSean Butterfield (47:50): That makes a lot of sense. As I said, as an observer just looking at it really from a data perspective, hearing input from the community and yourself. Overall, you just want an attractive protocol that's sustainable, that's healthy, that promotes growth, and encourages users. So it\u2019s a step in the right direction and I'll be curious to see how the next proposal that might try to bring the emissions down to zero will go. As we move forward, we touched on deposit volume a little bit. An 80% decline over the quarter, from $63 million to $13 million in deposits. DAI accounted for a lot of that and as Sami was mentioning, me and another couple folks were digging into some on-chain data and it looks like it's exclusive to a few market makers that were really trying to arbitrage between AAVE and Compound early or sometime in Q4. Not only is it super cool to see the on-chain data to kind of make those suggestions but it's also interesting to see that's really what drove a lot of quarterly deposit volume. Then also as we enter Q1 it looks like maybe a separate market maker was basically redeeming their funds from the protocol. Maybe in preparation for the reduction of COMP emissions towards the end of Q1. So yeah, really interesting to see as you look at the chart, it's a pretty glaring drop in quarterly volume. As we kind of wrap up here, at least as relates to charts, originations, same story. Demand for loans declined. The demand for new loans will follow. So seeing a 53% drop from $11 billion to $5 billion. What I thought was interesting is four consecutive quarters of the declining originations. I think that's largely related to the overall market sentiment but we might be curious if you have any kind of input or future outlook of originations moving forward.\n\nGetty Hill (50:25): You know, stats like volume and originations are a bit hard to nail down. Just because it's DeFi, capital is just extremely liquid. If folks want to leave and join the protocol for an instant they are welcome to do so with no penalty. So that makes these stats kind of hard to focus on and that goes back to the very first slide. The thing to really care about is that utilization number. So for me that's the number I focus on. Less so the originations and volume stats.\n\nSean Butterfield (50:56): That makes perfect sense to me. I mean like you said, you could easily throw a billion in and take a billion out inside of a day and it still contributes to originations or deposit volume on a quarterly basis. So that makes a lot of sense. So yeah, moving on into governance. It looks like there's about eight proposals that were passed in the quarter. I won't touch base on all of them, but I'd say there were a few that were pretty critical changes to the protocol. Sami, did you want to take a stab at those?\n\nSami Kassab (51:37): Yeah, so we talked about two of the really important ones, proposal 92 and proposal 100. I guess one of the other ones I found interesting was proposal 89 and that was reducing the proposal threshold from 65k COMP to 25k COMP. Which I think is important to stimulate further activity into the governance system. One thing I thought that was interesting was that we really didn't see that many voters on proposal 100, even though it might have been one of the more popular propositions or governance proposals. I think there were a total of 48 addresses. So Getty personally, have you seen that trying to get people to contribute to some of these governance proposals has been difficult?\n\nGetty Hill (52:37): You know, it's not so much the number for me as it is the amount of COMP that shows up to vote. These systems aren't democracies you know, we run on a plutocracy system here where it's based off of capital rather than who's present. So for me, it's what\u2019s the COMP turn out in these things? The COMP turnout was decent, it was pretty on par with the other significant proposals that we've had historically. It certainly could have been higher, I would have liked to see a number of folks turn out that didn't turn out. But I think for the most part it wasn't disappointing as a specific proposal. In general it'd be nice to see that we had a larger percentage of the COMP turnout to vote. As you know we're 6 million circulating supply, 6.5 million circulating supply. To only have a million turnout isn't terrible, but it isn't great either. It'd be nice to have two million turnout for these things as far as the number of voters goes. If you just check out on the Compound website there's great databases for this stuff. Really, once you get around to voter 50 as far as the leaderboard goes, the amount of votes really substantially drops off. A lot of these things are largely decided amongst the top 25 people, just because that's where the power is really contained as far as the number of votes, and who possesses those votes.\n\nSami Kassab (54:01): Yeah, any thoughts on potentially, I don't know if any protocols actually do this, but incentivizing people to contribute to, or just to vote in general?\n\nGetty Hill (54:16): I don't think that active voting is really important. That's kind of the weird part of this. So there should be more things to vote on in general. I think that's important, that's one of the reasons why I like the idea of 89 and that there's about three facets of making proposals right now. You either have enough votes delegated to you that you can make the proposal, or you either have the COMP yourself, and you know the total number of coins. Or you're on the white list. Essentially a thing that the community multisig in governance controls is the whitelist addresses with proposal power. The whitelist is neat but that's largely a social mechanism and so the first two are still the most critical ones for the protocol. You cannot call yourself a true DeFi protocol that has governance unless you have completely on-chain control of all the code and all the contracts that make up that system and make it accessible for anyone to come and change something about that system without asking anyone else for permission. That is to me, the core tenant here. So lowering the proposal threshold from 65 thousand to 25 thousand materially doesn't change the risk of the system, the quorum, the number of votes required to actually get a proposal to succeed, is remaining the same. Folks could actually argue to raise that number as well but the system should be more accessible to a larger populace to make those proposals. Not everyone is as fortunate as me. While I have a large percentage of my net worth in Compound, I don't actually have the 75 thousand votes that we have on the platform. We're lucky enough to have some folks who have those tokens that are willing to delegate to us since we pay a lot of attention to the protocol.\n\nSami Kassab (55:58): Gotcha, yes, proposal 89 really just increased decentralization and inclusivity of the protocol. So for the sake of time, I guess we'll speed through this next slide here just on grants. Is there a date yet related to when the new grant program will be back?\n\nGetty Hill (56:20): No, I mean I think it's a matter of a personnel problem. Essentially you just need someone to come in and run it. That person, if someone's listening here, listening to this recording is interested in trying to run a grants program for a protocol and might have some experience applicable to it. Do come to the forum, write a forum post, make your argument that you should do it. You can get paid quite handsomely to do this, this is by no means a side gig. Uniswap employs a team for their grants program and so do other protocols, and they all get paid quite handsomely. So I think it's really just a personal problem at this point. Everyone's for it but no one has the time or the bandwidth for the compensation that's being discussed.\n\nSean Butterfield (57:00): Yeah, just a couple last points as it relates to the road map a little bit. If you could maybe share some details on where we're at as it relates to the multi-chain strategy and then lastly, I know there are some limited details as well around Compound 3, but maybe if you could share what you can, what you know, and your general outlook on both of those.\n\nGetty Hill (57:30): Yeah, absolutely. So, I don't have any proprietary information. I'll say that first, I'm just for all intents and purposes, a community member and I know for a fact that really largely all the VCs are in the same boat. The Labs team, who's the core engineers behind the protocol, does a very good job of not telling anyone anything. So what we do know is really just the public information. So they've done two developer calls in recent times where they have discussed Compound 3 with folks. Generally it's a much slimmed down version of the protocol. Instead of the generalized money market right now where folks can deposit and borrow anything on either end, you're supplying a thing as collateral and you're only borrowing USDC or whatever that reserve asset is. So the first version as they've told everyone is going to be with USDC as the reserve asset. In theory that reserve asset could be anything else, which makes the system a bit interesting. You could have a bunch of little versions of Compound 3 like little silos where you could have one that's flavored to ETH where you're depositing a bunch of ETH derivatives and only borrowing ETH as the reserve. You could be depositing a bunch of Bitcoin derivatives and buying only wrapped Bitcoin as the reserve. All sorts of fun things could be done with this and I think that's kind of where they're going with it. A bit more of a gas efficient, simpler protocol to swallow and just generally more efficient. Like all the original smart contracts at this point are well over I think two years, and so that's the other main component here. Making it easier to deploy and run on the other chains. So frankly though we don't have tons of information as far as timeline goes in development, we know what they've stated is that there is the plan to post the open source version of the protocol in late April. So maybe this week, maybe next week, I'm not holding my breath. Maybe a couple weeks after that and then we'll get a testnet version of it the following month. The code is going to go to audit to Open Zeppelin and Open Zeppelin is the formal audit partner of the protocol so I think they're putting on the finishes with that and it's going to be going to Open Zeppelin here in the next few weeks, so I've heard through the grapevine. Then we'll kind of go from there. I mean, I think everyone's kind of hoping for a mainnet launch in July or something, or June. But everyone keep a massive grain of salt with everything I said because this is coming through about like 30 minutes worth of two different conversations, and everything is subject to change and I don't know anything really in reality. So, we'll see what comes. I think everyone's excited.\n\nSean Butterfield (01:00:06): Yeah, that sounds great. I was able to catch some of those calls and it does sound like the testnet is supposed to kick off shortly so I'm sure everyone's pretty excited about that. Real quick, it seems like the development's been a little different as it relates to the multi-chain strategy. I know the initial idea was to kind of go with that Starport integration and it seems like there were some development hiccups. As the landscape developed over DeFi and multi-chain strategies compromised platforms. It sounds like they were kind of trying to pivot to a different model? Are you able to maybe touch on that a little bit?\n\nGetty Hill (01:00:50): Yeah, I don't know much. I think the general idea was let's make the code simple and let's make it easy to deploy and easy to manage. There have been hints at additional tools to help manage all these different employments and some new testing tools throughout these protocols. It's been discussed that the new oracle solution that the protocol is going to go with is just going to be directly Chainlink. Which is advantageous for all the different chain deployments where there isn't necessarily robust on-chain liquidity that exists on Ethereum. But I mean largely we don't know. Again there's a lot of guessing work going on right now so I think we'll find out in the next few weeks here a lot more information. Then you even still have the product the next couple of months and it should be a fun summer.\n\nSean Butterfield (01:01:39): Yeah, sounds good, something to look forward to. I don't know if Sami, if you had any other questions on our end? You know we're pretty much rounding the hour here so I think the questions from the community have been submitted and I think we've kind of touched base on that. If any other viewers have any questions please feel free to throw them down, otherwise it's been a good time. I've really enjoyed having you and hearing all your insight.\n\nGetty Hill (01:02:24): For folks who are interested in following along with Compound in general there's the forum at compound.xyz. There's the governance action forum on Compound Finance, you can check out the proposals that exist there. Join the Discord as well. There's a developer call that exists every Wednesday in the morning, well every other Wednesday. Then on the other Wednesdays that aren't the Compound lab developer call I tend to run a community call on Twitter that's a bit more casual than the formal developer call. In general for folks who are interested in following GFX Labs and our interesting governance on Uniswap, MakerDAO, and Compound, and the other awesome products that we're developing over here. Which is in fact, what really I spend most of my time on, believe it or not. Do check out GFX Labs and Poppy Finance and Etherlands, all the rest of our main projects.\n\nSean Butterfield (01:03:04): Awesome, well thanks again. Sami, thanks for joining as well. I hope everyone has a beautiful weekend and we'll do this again next time.\n\nSami Kassab (01:03:13): Yeah this was fun, thanks everyone!\n\nGetty Hill (01:03:15): Thanks for having me, cheers!", "references": [{"name": "Sean Butterfield", "url": ""}], "published_at": "2022-04-23T14:49:00Z", "author": {"name": "Sean Butterfield"}, "tags": ["Quarterly-Reports", "Decentralized-Finance"], "url": "https://messari.io/article/state-of-compound-q1-2022-analyst-call-transcript"}, {"id": "967e89f1-9075-418b-8afe-698687cb2ffa", "title": "State of Avalanche Q1 2022 Analyst Call Transcript", "content": "If you would like to view the full recording of the live Crowdcast event, you can find it on our YouTube channel. You can also read the full Quarterly Report by James Trautman here.\n\nParticipants:\n\nJames Trautman - Messari research analyst\nJohn Nahas - Ava Labs\nEd Chang - Ava Labs\nLuigi DeMeo - Ava Labs\nNick Mussallem - Ava Labs\n\nJim Trautman (0:06): Okay, I think we're live. We're gonna get a check. Good thumbs up, good to go. All right. Perfect, all right. So good to see some of you again. Nick and John, we've had a chance to meet once before. Luigi, welcome. I\u2019m going to just kind of set the stage for why we are here in case we have some new folks joining us for the first time. Really, the purpose for us being here is that Messari has been working on quarterly reporting, similar to what we see in a traditional world especially in traditional finance when evaluating companies and these sorts of things but at the same time very very different. You know, it's like there's nothing traditional about what we're doing here, especially when it comes to reporting. The point is that capturing events and capturing data in different time series allows us to evaluate you know really how things are going whether that be through certain data, certain trends or simply you know strategies that any endeavor is putting into place and that could be companies involved, it can be enterprises utilizing the technology, as well as the community itself driving it forward. Really that's why we are here and we are revisiting now the first quarter of 2022. Subsequent to having covered the last quarter for 2021, which was a pivotal quarter for Avalanche. A lot is going on, so the first quarter of this year is no exception. It's the same story, we're not going to boil everything in an hour. There's a lot to cover so hopefully we cover everything. We're going to try to have a conversation that if it's the first time to this call or your first time kind of looking into what the Avalanche ecosystem is and what's going on, we want to be able to provide some insight there all the way down to really, really deep into the community and hopefully we can provide some insight at a deeper level so you know that's why we're here. Today we're really going to talk about you guys, introductions, a high overview of what we're seeing over the first quarter, and that involves the network at a high level of what's going on with the network. Specifically, forms of usage, daily transactions, and these sorts of things. That's more quantitative and then it's sort of trying to tie that then to the actual ecosystem and sort of bringing it back to more qualitative manners that fundamentally we can start to think about the value that's actually coming to this space. It's easy to look at price, market cap, and be like \u201coh it's valuable\u201d and see this data but, what we're trying to do is really flesh out what's the driver. What's fundamentally happening here that's driving everything and what are the efforts that everyone that's involved, and how is that driving. That's ultimately why we're here. I'm a research analyst with Messari and have the honor to cover the Avalanche network and ecosystem and cover it on a quarterly basis. So that's about me but from there let's just start with a quick introduction of who you guys are, who Ava Labs is, what is Avalanche for those that are just completely unfamiliar, and your relationship with the Avalanche network.\n\n  \nJohn Nahas (4:34): Nick, you want to kick it off with introducing yourself, and then I'll go.\n\n  \nNick Mussallem (4:40): Sure. James thanks for having us back. Nick Mussallem, I'm the head of product at Ava Labs and so my teams are really focused on the road mapping strategy, product strategy, and competitive analysis, and then we have a project management team that leads the execution of those. We have a very talented design team that takes that strategy and makes it visual and considers the user experience. And then we also have a product analytics team that really kind of tells us how we're doing once we take things out to market. That's a summary of me and our teams.\n\n  \nJohn Nahas (5:17): John Nahas, Vice President, Co-Head of BD, I oversee the BD team at Ava Labs covering five verticals: DeFi, GameFi, culture, and social. So NTF\u2019s,\u00a0 institutional capital markets, as well as exchanges and wallets. We've got Luigi here from the DeFi team and on GameFi so I\u2019ll let Luigi introduce himself.\n\n  \nLuigi DeMeo (5:43): Thanks, John. Hey guys, Luigi DeMeo head of DeFi here at Ava Labs. I apologize in advance for the video and audio quality, but I span across BD and the strategy of all of our labs for DeFi and help grow this ecosystem as much as possible.\n\n  \nJohn Nahas (6:08): Can we get Ed in here?\n\n  \nJim Trautman (6:10): I'd say not yet. We'll dive into that a little bit more.\u00a0 We'll let Ed in when we can. We're limited to the number of folks that we can have on the call so we'll have to bring people in as we get into the deeper dives into specific topics. So I guess pretty quickly to any of you, what is it and what is Avalanche. We've discussed this before, but again for anybody that's new, what is it and what is Ava Labs\u2019 relationship to it?\n\n  \nJohn Nahas (6:45): Absolutely. So Ava Labs, where we all work, is the firm that created the Avalanche blockchain. Now Avalanche is an open-source, Layer One blockchain so Ava Labs is a service provider to the Avalanche Foundation. We help with BD, with marketing and development on the protocol level, as well as a lot of other work that we do with enterprises and partners. Avalanche, as most of you know, is a new Layer One blockchain launched in September of 2020. Avalanche utilizes a novel new consensus which is the Avalanche consensus which allows us to achieve speed, high throughput, and the entirety of the network is actually very eco-friendly. Based on a recent expert study, the entirety of the Avalanche blockchain utilizes 46 U.S. households worth of carbon which is really low in the proof-of-stake family relative to some others in our group and infinitely more green than the proof-of-work chains of course. Avalanche is a multi-chain architecture. We have an X-Chain where you're able to create, mint, and burn assets with limited business logic. We have a P-Chain where validation delegation occurs, but also the ability to create permissioned or permissionless chains, what we call subnets, which I'm sure we're going to dive into a little bit later. And then of course our C-Chain which is our EVM compatible smart contract chain. That's where a majority of the action that you see in DeFi and NFT\u2019s is occurring so think of us as an L1, but in some capacities, you can even think of us as a Layer Zero allowing for a true Web3 economy to grow and to see the transfer value continue.\n\n  \nJim Trautman (8:25): Great sense. Okay, thank you for the introduction. Let's kind of just move into why we're here and really set down Q1 of this year. So I'm going to share my screen. Hopefully, we might see all of us for a moment. Just let me know when you see this sort of report in front of you. Good on that?\n\n  \nNick Mussallem (9:08): Yeah, we can see it.\n\n  \nJim Trautman (9:25): Okay great. All right, so as I mentioned we are now more or less tracking in a 90-day interval the development and progression of the Avalanche ecosystem, the Avalanche network. Sort of very quickly revisiting the fourth quarter of 2021 because while we can always just look at a snapshot of the last three months or the quarter, there's always a relationship to the prior quarter that we need to bring into the discussion and one thing that we'd asked last quarter because it was an explosive quarter at the end of the day and all given fronts of every metric that you can evaluate and every partnership and everything that was going on in terms of any given growth strategy, we asked why. Some things are not in this report and John you had mentioned the importance and we spoke about it at length last quarter about one of the things that is important to anyone that will engage with the Avalanche ecosystem is the eco-friendly carbon footprint that the blockchain leaves. In this quarter there was actually more data that came out about that and it's not in this report because it's not easily tied to the data that we're evaluating. I just wanted to call that out and then it is a big reason for folks to want to use this particular platform. That said, there were many partnerships executed and things that were basically in the works as we headed into the first quarter of 2022, and the narrative really that I took away from this first quarter is that there was continued growth. What I\u2019m kind of showing here right now, and we'll step away from this is what the report is all about and I just want to share with the audience what we're trying to do is give any reader key takeaways of the quarter and provide data, provide some background on Avalanche itself and ultimately tie it back to anything qualitatively going on. So just a preview of the report itself. Let's see, let's focus more so on the data that's within the report itself. We want to make sure you all can see this. That the state of Avalanche Q1 2022, is it visible to you all?\n\n  \nNick Mussallem (12:28): Yeah, James we can see we're on the Avalanche key metrics summary page.\n\n  \nJim Trautman (12:31): Perfect, okay. So as I mentioned we did see continued growth and in the report, I refer to it I think in one spot as modest growth, but that's really compared to the fourth quarter when you see network usage and network financial metrics growing at 500% or 600% and so on and so forth and I think in some cases into the thousands of percentage points. In Q1 we saw continued growth, but not like we saw in Q4, but calling out that it's still growth. What stood out to me was continued growth in active daily addresses. So just regular interaction with the network. We saw a 33%\u00a0 increase in that metric as well as daily transactions. One of the other ones that stands out to me again is we knew we saw a 72% increase in revenue and from an evaluation point of view, that actually put downward pressure on what we call the price-to-sales ratio which suggests, you know, it's not perfectly vetted from the financial perspective on the complete meaningful point that this metric has, but relatively when you look at it across the space there is some insight from it. And what we're leading to is again, there's always a question as to why. Here's the Avalanche address group and of course, we see over the fourth quarter amazing growth and then we get into the New Year and it was actually in January that we saw an all-time high of active address growth and there was a statistic in there that the first week of January actually consisted of more activity than all of October, but since then we've sort of stabilized. So that's the other narrative. A lot of times what we see in other networks is a lot of growth, and then it subsides. It reverses course and it's volatile. And while there's some volatility here, we're still seeing some stability in that. Well, actually, I shouldn't say some, but quite a bit of stability in activity. Similarly, it's the same with daily transactions. We're seeing an upward trend there and we have plotted here against that transaction fees. So I wanted to kind of start with that. As we think about why the continued growth in activity, daily transactions, and also interestingly enough what's going on with these transactions? So I'll come back to that but, in my findings, and you guys can speak to this, but as we crossed over into the New Year there was the really the launch, the unleashing of the custom EVM subnets. I think that's part of what we were seeing here. Also, I had seen some releases of Apricot. But first, if I may ask, what is the importance of the EVM subnet? And there was a JSON file that was also released that I believe made it very easy for folks to develop and create their own EVM custom subnet. Can you explain a little bit about that shift and what that means?\n\n  \nJohn Nahas (16:33): James, I'll turn this over to Nick and then to Luigi to add on to the subnet, but real quick just want to recap some of the important things that you highlighted. We've seen sustainable and consistent growth to your point. There's usually a burst and then it tapers off. We've seen the doubling of transactions, we've seen continued usage, we've seen continued growth with new applications continuing to grow, new innovation on the chain, new projects, new teams building. So that initial kick that we got from Q4 has really continued into Q1 and I know we're going to discuss a lot of the things that we have coming that came about in Q1 that are really going to propel us in Q2, but I think it's a really important metric, to highlight that there's a consistent and sustainable growth in users and transactions and in partnerships across the board. But to your point on the EVM subnets, Nick, do you want to jump in?\n\n  \nNick Mussallem (17:34): Sure. So we're at a very exciting time where we start to see GameFi really start to explode on-chain and with the advent of any kind of high transaction high throughput application you're going to need to be able to horizontally scale, and subnets of course are our horizontal scaling solution. It's been a very exciting quarter as we've launched DeFi Kingdoms onto that subnet. So as we start to do this we're starting to tackle a lot of the questions around subnets are they're ready to be used. You can deploy them very easily. There's a ton of documentation on them but there's a whole satellite of utilities that need to be there in order to properly support subnets which is while we're moving into the development of Core and which is our wallet experience which is going to have support for all subnets which we'll be launching very soon as well as explorer support.\u00a0 Each and every subnet needs to have its own explorer. So we're building out the mechanism to launch these subnets. But when you launch them, you also need to launch the utilities rim which also includes things like API\u2019s and our endpoints that are needed to successfully run them. So that's what we're seeing around subnets. We've got the baseline technology there and we're starting to see rapid usage of it in very innovative ways so we keep making it smoother and easier for the builders and also for the users to access them and engage with them and really leverage other kinds of utilities to get the most out of them. That's the focus in Q1 and then going into Q2 as well.\n\n  \nJohn Nahas (19:20): Luigi, do you want to touch upon the importance of EVM subnets of course in regards to DeFi and everything else?\n\n  \nLuigi DeMeo (19:23): Yeah, I'd be happy to. So I think Nick touched on it well. Subnet EVM allows you to deploy a subnet in one line of code. It's an EVM-based subnet so what this allows is it allows applications to deploy on the Avalanche C-Chain where a lot of our activity sits. Once they get to a certain level of activity and require more transactions and throughput, they can easily divert into their own subnet once they build the community and kind of naturally horizontally scale the network. What that does is two things: it allows the transactions on the main chain or the C-Chain to go down and fees go down, but it also allows overall network throughput to go up. This is just a way of horizontal scaling. Just to touch on the address chart a little bit just to give a little context, I think it's important to look at those numbers from a relative perspective. Crypto in general topped at the end of November and since then we've sort of seen it across the board, whether it be Bitcoin, Ethereum, alt chains, Coinbase earnings across the board, we've sort of seen a stagnation since that time period. What's important for Avalanche is Avalanche was able to experience explosive growth and usage and retain all that usage during this time period. I think that's the key. People came for new incentives, especially as it relates to Avalanche Rush and DeFi and they stayed and I think that's the important component to think about from that standpoint.\n\n  \nJim Trautman (20:59): Yeah definitely. That's again one of my takes, and by the way as an analyst with Messari, I'm really not in the community. I'm not as far down as everybody else probably is when it comes to the Avalanche ecosystem. My job is simply to look at data, try to understand it, look at trends, see what's going on there and let it drive the discussion. The takeaway primitive where Q1 was again, continued growth and what I am referring to as stability and I see it as a potential foundation for the next potential wave of growth whether that comes through NFT\u2019s, DeFi, GameFi, enterprise or commercial uses. We'll see, but that was my takeaway so I echo your sentiment about that stability. One of the things I wanted to talk about a little bit more was vertical scaling but we probably don't have time to go that far into that topic in particular. But really quickly, I do want to revisit what we see here in the past in a lot of volatility with the daily transactions on average up until the point where there was a release of Apricot. After that point, that was right here, what we saw is I think an actual impact from that release and I think that's very interesting to see. I would call this period of time very stable compared to what we saw in the past. Especially at a time when daily transactions on average are going up. A couple of statistics about daily transactions by the way; on average Avalanche is approaching about 74% of Ethereum's daily transactions on average. There were times when it reached about 90% or more, roughly a little bit more than what Ethereum was processing on any given day. Meanwhile, transaction fees are stabilizing. There is still a little bit of an uptrend that's moving in tandem with network users and transactions. This is all happening now at the same time as subnets are rolling out.\u00a0 So should we expect to see daily transaction fees continue to stabilize and even if anything, reverse course as more subnets are launched?\n\n  \nNick Mussallem (23:53): Yeah, so James I can jump in there. Absolutely. I think what you're seeing a lot in the increase of transactions has a lot to do with GameFi and just the nature of the bulk of what comes through there. The kind of horizontal scaling work that's done as a part of Apricot in the five phases really focuses on those things, which is how do we take the original mainnet launch and how do we make it faster? How do we reduce the fees? How do we make it more stable? How do we improve liveness? That's the focus and we'll continue to focus on that, but as we start to see other projects that come in and say need their own subnet because they want to have specific functionality that maybe is around lower fees higher throughput and they're starting to use things like pre-compiles that are specific to gaming. That will allow them to achieve these things very easily and when those games start to move into the subnets you'll start to see congestion on the mainnet drop and then you'll start to see fees drop. In summary, the continued focus on Apricot in the horizontal scaling of the mainnet implementation plus the advent and the maturity of subnets will have both of those effects. Faster transactions, lowering fees, and also providing scaling solutions.\n\n  \nJohn Nahas (25:24): I think it's important to add on to Nick's point. As you mentioned, fees have gone down. They are ticking a little bit up as usage ticks up but I think Avalanche as a platform prioritizes safety and liveness above any and all things. So in this respect, we are taking a very conservative approach. We would rather have a little bit higher fees, but have the network continue to run without any interruption, without any downtime, without any issues, because ultimately that's the goal. You need to be on 24/7/365 to keep up with this existing market. If we were to be a little too aggressive, we could end up having some issues as we've seen across the board with others and that's just not the attitude or the stance that we would like to take. We'd rather be on the cautious side, on the conservative side, and work to bring down the transaction fees gradually to a comfortable spot that doesn't affect network usage.\n\n  \nJim Trautman (26:40): Yeah that makes perfect sense. And look, I think with any of these networks there are always these trade-offs and there's a responsible way of rolling them out that doesn't just happen overnight. So there's a strategy to make it work with a long-term vision. That's what we're going to track again and that's why we're doing what we're doing. We're going to be able to, next quarter, continue on with this trend and see with the number of subnets that launch, how much activity from each, and what sort of impact that has. But at the end of the day, we still know that vertical scaling and horizontal scaling is underway and what we're seeing now is more of a stable trend.\n\nAnd then, of course, a strategy is in place, so I found this very interesting. I found this chart and data very interesting. Now, really quickly, I do want to dive into what it means in terms of revenue. Some folks out there are concerned if the transaction fees go down, then that means there's less revenue to the protocol. But I don't think that's necessarily true. I think that's a bit to be determined, but I do call in this analysis there's clearly a relationship between the value of the network versus the revenue. So if daily revenue were to go down as a result of subnets, and there is a relationship that holds the value of it in the short term, I'm concerned that the value of the network is going to go down. But the benefits of the subnet, correct me if I'm wrong, are of course in addition to being able to scale and thinking about it long-term it opens up not only use cases, but it will allow for the ecosystem to expand in other ways that will drive additional value. One of those other pieces that I think about is the infrastructure itself. Every subnet will participate in validating the network so I would expect that while transactions need to go down or stabilize, however that will look, we're going to see an expansion of the network itself. The number of validators going up the distribution of stake, further moving it, and being more diversified. Is that is that fair to say in question one? Then question two is if that is fair to say, what does that mean about the value of the network in your opinion?\n\n  \nNick Mussallem (29:36): Sure so John why don't I kick this off and then you can. So I think strategically we don't feel like we want the cost of using the network to have to go up in order to drive underlying chain revenue or the value. So our goal is always going to be to make the chain affordable. As we make the chain affordable we also want to be able to scale it. These are the hard parts, right? How do you scale horizontally? How do we achieve that? We're achieving that with subnets. So we really will just keep scaling the network horizontally, providing the necessary utilities for builders to get to market affordably and quickly, and easily. With things like explorers, wallets, RPC endpoints, and interoperability between subnets to subnets, and subnets to mainnets, and subnets to other chains. So if we feel that we can provide all of that value in an easy-to-use package then we're going to be giving the users what they really want which is a very affordable chain that also scales.\n\n  \nJim Trautman (30:48): Got it. Okay well, I think we got into that enough. It's an important trend that we're seeing. It's an interesting thing. There's a lot of chatter in the world in and outside of the community. Of course, other communities that will point these sorts of things out and have concerns but it's not if you just take a step back. Think about it, to determine what is actually happening here, it's really interesting, in my opinion on that front, so and I think everything that you said right there makes sense on the direction of usage and where its value will come from and its ability to scale.\n\n  \nNick Mussallem (31:40): James, I'll just throw real quickly there that every validator that validates subnets has to be validated. The kind of magic number is no less than five. Each validator has to stake a box right and we didn't want to have to enforce that every subnet use AVAX as its native token because that's taking flexibility away from the builder which would have been an obvious choice in order to increase the usage of the underlying token. But we think that there's a bunch of other kinds of network means from having subnets that will increase the utilization of AVAX and the underlying tokens that are launched on these subnets and so that is a whole growth system.\n\n  \nJim Trautman (32:22): Yeah for sure and I think part of that will show up in the development and decentralization aspect as an overview in our reports as well. So it'll all be tied together and be really interesting to see. We'll probably talk about it more next. Okay, thank you for that. That's kind of like getting into the network overview aspect of what we're looking at quarterly. We could spend the entire hour discussing all of these things and going even further but since time's ticking, I do want to move into the ecosystem itself and developer activities. Then I think from here we'll end up diving a little bit further into DeFi and GameFi and we'll bring our GameFi folks on to the call. But really quickly, I just want to point out that over the course of Q1, we did see a pretty significant increase in core developer activity. I suspect that it has everything to do with everything that we just talked about including EVM custom subnets and as well. I think some new incentives are in play here. And two of those incentives will be referred to as the Multiverse Fund or Multiverse Incentive Program and the Culture Catalyst Program. Can you guys sort of just give a high level of what each of those programs really represents and what you're going after there and sort of the outcome that we've seen so far?\u00a0 Any partnerships that have come out of those programs and where there's some traction?\n\n  \nJohn Nahas (34:27): Absolutely, so I think as we remember from Q4, Rush is really what started a lot of the push for us to grow. That was a DeFi incentive program. We've now moved on to both the Multiverse Incentive Program which is about $290 million worth of incentives to support the growth and expansion of subnets as well as a Culture Catalyst, which is a $100 million to support artists and creators of build or grow their fan base and launch assets on Avalanche. A key caveat here to keep in mind, something that Avalanche focuses on, or that we focus on, is incentivizing the user. A lot of people give out grants. A lot of people do a lot of things. Our core belief, and the way we look at growing adoption, is we want the best teams to come and deploy their products and projects on us. We want people to build on us, and if they do so we'll incentivize the user to come and try it. And then those incentives start to wean off as we've seen with Rush. So that brought DeFi to the fore. Multiverses is focused on increasing the growth of subnets. So that's either incentives for users to come and try a specific subnet as we've seen with DeFi Kingdoms which is doing about a quarter-million transactions a day right now. We're also building out an institutional subnet for DeFi. You might have seen some of the participants there. Jump, Wintermute Golden Tree Asset Management, Valkyrie Securities, amongst many others that are also coming into that group. What the point there is that we're going to really look to provide TradFi players who want to work in DeFi with a regulated kind of permission chain where they can do the things they would do in DeFi, but with trusted and KYC counterparties. If you're a financial institution you cannot be providing liquidity to a market or borrowing when you don't know who the other counterparty is or if that other person could be from a sanctioned country or on a no-fly list or anything of that nature. Now, in a permission DeFi subnet, you don't know who the counterparty is, but you know that all the parties in there have gone through the necessary checks so whether it's institutional DeFi, whether it's enterprise, whether it's GameFi, the multiverse is there to help support these people by either giving them incentives to stand up their own validators so that they can run their own subnet and that's in the form of AVAX. We'll give them some AVAX and get that back once they're set up on their feet. We'll do incentives like we did with DeFi Kingdoms to get users in there. So that's really the crux of multiverse, to really expand the usage and allow builders to really come and not have that overhead to launch a subnet. We'll help them out initially until they get up on their feet with that and then we'll get back what we need and let them kind of grow on their own. On the Culture Catalyst, I'd love to get Ed to jump in on this as well. What we're really doing is spurring creators and artists. So we've partnered with a great team at Op3n that's O-p-3-n, so it's an app that's akin to a Spotify for artists, creators, and musicians to really have a fan base. NFT\u2019s that are more than just art but that link to communities that have fan access and engagement and I'll let Ed talk about the first one. The first project there that we announced at our summit in Barcelona and give kind of a high level as what we see coming down the pipe there.\n\n  \nEd Chang (38:08): Yeah thanks, John. So like John said, we've set aside a co-funding opportunity for up to $100 million for this program.\u00a0 It\u2019s called the Culture Catalyst. We are working with Op3n and they have the pulse on all things entertainment so you know the direct line to musicians, and you know film producers and IP and influencers. So everything we're going to be doing is really about jump-starting that NFT community on Avalanche and really fostering the growth there and bringing in more of a retail audience as well. The first project that we had announced at Summit is with Grimes the singer, the producer, and the director. She's actually, now with the birth of her second kid, looking to put together kind of an NFT children's book based around crypto. There's going to be a music video around that. Kind of a new song she's launching that'll be the first one that we announce. There are a few other really exciting ones in the pipeline geared around the film and music industries that we're really excited about. Think about NFT\u2019s as membership NFT\u2019s as your calling card to deeper access with some of these artists and apparel and other things that it unlocks. So we're really excited about what we're doing there.\n\n  \nJohn Nahas (39:22):Ed while once you jump in a little bit and talk about just multiverses and its impact on GameFi the growth that we've seen in GameFi this quarter because I think that's really really stuck out the most.\n\n  \nEd Chang (39:33): Yeah, so you know my core focus here has been on the GameFi side and we've seen a lot of growth over the last two quarters. We've gone from this narrative of a lot of these casual-like, idle games built, moving forward into more core double a triple a experiences we've announced partnerships with a lot of these really new games. Here, looking at the launch of subnets, the first two subnets that are going to be launching. DeFi Kingdoms already launched and we've got Crabada really close behind them following with the launch of battle mode. So, when we look at the pipeline of the different games out there, it's looking really healthy in terms of the games that we've announced and that are in development right now. As well as some of the games that are kind of stealth right now that are waiting to be announced in this quarter and the latter half of this year.\n\n  \nJim Trautman (40:32): Yeah, that makes sense. And again I think we can see that impacting all the activity as again, we started with this discussion around some developments and DeFi Kingdoms. We knew that was coming and that it went live right at the end of the quarter. There's more to say about it, but in the window of Q1, it was right at the end. I think it was the day or two before, and we actually did start to see data rolling in through various explorers as it relates to DeFi Kingdoms. So yeah, that'll be, I think, a hot topic for the next quarter. The other one is Crabada. Is that how you say it correctly?\n\n  \nEd Chang (41:16): Yeah, Crabada, nailed it.\n\n  \nJim Trautman (41:18): And again, DeFi Kingdoms is part of the multiverse program at this point. Obviously, there's going to be some incentive there to continue to develop a little bit. Can you just give us a real high level of what it is Crababada and this is generating a lot of activity on a test net right now. Can you just kind of give us a high level or is that where we bring in our expert on Crabada?\n\n  \nEd Chang (41:55): Yeah, so Crabada is one of the early games in the ecosystem. At any given moment they're taking between 15-40 percent of the gas on the c-chain. People love the crabs. It's effectively like an idle game that you need three of these crab NFT\u2019s to play. They are moving towards more of an Axi-type battle mode game and they've got other things planned on their road map that they've teased out. People are always running looting missions and mining missions and getting tokens from that and there's this whole economy and community built around that. So this is kind of their core game that they're launching their subnet on called the Swimmer Network. The vision here, the reason they're not calling it the Crabada subnet, is because they're looking to be more of a publisher of games. So they're going to be launching their idle game there, they're going to be launching their battle mode game and then they're looking to potentially bring on other titles who are looking to be on the subnet to capitalize on that community. So you can see where the economics get really interesting. Where they have an inflationary token called TUS, similar to Axi\u2019s SLP but it drives more value. And now they have another mechanism that they can burn a lot of that TUS and they can also take some of that and go reward their validators. And if more and more games are using that in their marketplace for their games, there's that additive value being driven to the token and the network itself.\n\n  \nJim Trautman (43:25): Makes sense. I was able to dig up some initial data on the Crabada subnets again, seeing it very quickly grow so collectively as we see more and more of this occur, we'll try to tie it back to the growth strategy that's in place as well as translates into the activity and the data that we're collecting along the way. I think DeFi Kingdoms and Crabada are examples and I know it's impossible for us to exactly pinpoint what is driving every aspect of the activity, but when you start to sort of timeline things and time stamp and look at how the network is reacting to it, I think it's pretty clear that that there is an impact from the rollout of subnets and really the introduction of GameFi into the Avalanche ecosystem. So anything else on the DeFi front? We're already 10 minutes to the hour so?\n\n  \nJohn Nahas (44:32) I'll just add Luigi's been having connection issues. But, I'll just add on the DeFi front, I think what you really saw, and this was part of our ambition and our goal that we set for ourselves in Q4 and that really played out in Q1, was that you know, with Rush, we brought blue-chip DeFi protocols on like Aave, Curve, Sushi etc. That gave people comfort coming to use it and then we saw existing native Avalanche applications grow. We saw new Avalanche native applications grow, but what we saw really in Q1 is really the launch of new novel projects on Avalanche that previously didn't exist or were tried to be built somewhere else. We saw some teams that were native to Ethereum such as Alpha Labs launch their Alpha X product on us first. The speed of the chain, and the lower cost made it easier for people within other communities to develop applications that have been launched on Avalanche and for the developer community within Avalanche to grow whether it be Platypus, which was just a single-sided stable swap. We recently had Yeti launch. We've seen the Platypus wars akin to the Curve wars. Now we're starting to see the Joe wars akin to that as well so we're really starting to see a native community of builders and developers grow build projects on Avalanche to continue that growth in DeFi, in terms of development and new contracts. So you know all the metrics that matter have definitely been trending in the right way so we are really excited to see the community continue to grow, and to innovate as the network grows.\n\n  \nJim Trautman (46:23): Yeah for sure. A few quick bits that I gathered on the DeFi front is that Platypus Finance is the fastest growing DeFi protocol over the quarter. There was what is referred to as the long tail, so the number of protocols that have a million or more in TVL, stabilized. So kind of look at that as a greater distribution of TVL so I think that's a sign of health in the DeFi space. You know of course Rush has a little bit to do with that and you know all sorts of things that also then translates into developer activities so we saw a greater number of growth in contracts deployed over the quarter and that's all tied into that. We'd love to dive a little bit further into that and try to boil the ocean inside of an hour here. But let's just take a few quick minutes to like one or two high-level events that stand out to you. To me the Summit stands out to me. I was there and didn't have a chance to meet you all but gathered a lot of information. I guess a few of the top-of-mind sort of partnerships or efforts that you guys are working on. Maybe it's\u00a0 Grimes or maybe these other things and again I'm talking about a minute because I want to leave the time for some questions, as well as what's ahead. I could mention Core, we know that that's on the way, and user experience is on the way. So yeah, putting it on you to like two minutes more or less, what's exciting to you as of recent developments in terms of continued development, and what's ahead, what can we expect, if you can, whatever you can show?\n\n  \nJohn Nahas (48:15): So I\u2019ll kick this off and then I\u2019ll turn over to Nick to talk on the product side. I think instead of two I\u2019m going to give you three things. I think one, what you saw was a continued growth on the BD side of the infrastructure level and that kind of the pipes and the roads that helped to build out an ecosystem so you saw USDT launch after USDC\u00a0 launched natively at the end of Q4, but you've seen both of those start to grow. You've seen an expansion in exchanges whether it be FTX or others. You've seen exchanges now on onboard USDC and USDT native to Avalanche. All these things, custody,\u00a0 staking, and wallets, just continue to grow so we're reaching more people. The pipeline in and out of the network is getting easier. Fiat on-and-off ramps and everything there. So that really is the foundational layer that's been growing that allows the builders to come in for the users to try the network and to grow from there. I think the second thing of course is the Culture Catalyst and Multiverse to really drive continued growth with subnets across GameFi, DeFi, enterprise. I think you saw with enterprise last quarter I know he touched on Deloitte, but of course, Ava labs is a partner with Mastercard Star Path program and working with them to kind of put together some pretty cool POC\u2019s hopefully in the future as well as Lemonade right an Insurtech insurance provider to work and create a proof-of-concept Parametric Insurance Program that can be rolled out globally to those that are underserved in the insurance markets but hopefully one day can lead to the inclusion of smart contracts from blockchain technology into traditional insurance. That's the second thing and I think the third thing to culminate the quarter was truly the Summit. I think it was more a culmination of several years worth of work for us to arrive at that point. It was fantastic to see so many people. I'm pretty sure we could have had a lot more but we're really looking forward to continuing that trend. That was our first Summit, our first inaugural Avalanche event and I think it was a great illustration of the diversity of this community whether it be builders, partners, investors, friends, and everything across the board. I think what you're gonna see this coming quarter is really the multiverse expand, the growth of subnets and Culture Catalyst really take a leading role going from there. I'll turn it over to Nick to talk on the product part.\n\n  \nNick Mussallem (50:45): Sure. I'll be real quick because I know we want to take some questions. So I think we've talked about scaling and that's a huge priority for us. We're attacking that with subnets and then the second goal is to really make crypto on Avalanche more accessible to everybody. How do we leverage this great technology and that solution is in Core. So Core is really this curated Web3 operating system that allows users to really access the best parts of crypto in a way that they can understand everything's native to Avalanche itself so you're not having to know how to add custom tokens or deal with smart contracts directly. It's really designed to really give people a comfortable experience to be able to interact with the chain and then two other things is the Bridge, so the addition of Bitcoin support to the Bridge so the ability to natively bridge bitcoin across. You'll be able to do that through the Core extension so we'll have bridging embedded into the extension itself to make it as easy as possible. And then finally make it easier for the builders to get to market and that really is expanding our partnership with AWS and starting to look to ways to deploy and manage blockchain and specifically manage subnets.\n\n  \nJim Trautman (51:59): Perfect, thank you. I know we're speeding up here in terms of all the concepts and discussions to get into, so really quick I'm going to wrap it up in like 30 seconds to try to field a couple of questions and we'll move on. Again, continued growth, and stabilization of the network across metrics and across the ecosystem. We saw the EVM custom subnets kind of roll out things that we didn't mention partnerships with other protocols like Terra partnerships with enterprises, Wildlife Studios, DeFi Kingdoms launching Crabada launching, a lot going on so you know I guess for the folks that aren't terribly familiar here, take a look at the quarterly report to get more detail you know as well as all the resources that are out there available to the community. All right, so quickly going to try and take at least one question if I can figure out exactly where they are.\n\n  \nJohn Nahas (53:08): Yeah, let's grab some questions.\n\n  \nJim Trautman (53:28): How about that? I'm still sharing, aren't I? Here we go. Let me squeeze into that. We might go a minute or two over. All right, let's see. \u201cI think Terra is one of the main competitors for Avalanche. How does Avax plan to compete with Terra and especially its stable coin? Does Avalanche plan to release its own stablecoin?\u201d\n\n  \nJohn Nahas (54:04): Can you repeat it one more time James? You cut out for me in the beginning.\n\n  \nJim Trautman (54:06): Sorry about that. So I just mentioned Terra. \u201cI think Terra is one of the main competitors for Avalanche. How does Avax plan to compete with Terra and especially its Avalanche plan to release its own stablecoin?\u201d\n\n  \nJohn Nahas (54:25): So that's actually a great question for the simple reason that you know there's a narrative out there that L1\u2019s or the other L1\u2019s have to be competitors and we don't see Terra as a competitor. We're all in this to grow this pie in this industry and this entire ecosystem together. That's why we partnered with Terra. We partnered with Terra as you might have seen in the news, and AVAX is going to be backing UST through that purchase. Luigi can jump in and get some more color on that partnership but we don't have any plans on launching a stable coin. Why would we when there's a great one out there that we can partner with and help solidify? So Luigi, do you want to jump in and talk a little bit about that?\n\n  \nLuigi DeMeo (55:00): Yeah sure. Sorry for the issues again from before, but yeah I mean we obviously had this very large announcement with respect to Terra and you know Terra's main goal is at least for my conversations with Do [Kwon] and that team is to grow UST adoption. Terra is a zone of Cosmos that is the chain that they do and LUNA is the staking token of that zone which helps secure the network. So that inherently drives some value to that token which helps to secure it for the stablecoin. From our standpoint, we have one of the most robust DeFi ecosystems out there which is obviously attractive for a decentralized stablecoin. So the partnership really makes sense from both sides. The DeFi ecosystem that needs a decentralized stablecoin and then the decentralized coin that wants to be integrated within a very robust and diverse DeFi ecosystem which Avalanche has at this point. So I think it's just a natural fit from that lens.\n\n  \nJim Trautman (56:04): Makes sense. I mean you mentioned last quarter John that you know it's really not about competition. I think even in my report I called out a competitive analysis that's more of a traditional way of evaluating this. It's more of like a peer group, everybody has their own place and it's all about driving things forward and of course a lot of the credit goes back to Ethereum and the Ethereum community. So, we are out of time. I wish that we could ask more questions but I know that you guys are super busy and I want to be respectful of that so next time I will be a better moderator and try to leave a little time in the end for questions and of course, I would say to you all and the community and all the audience I\u2019m wide open to feedback on any metrics that aren't in this report. Anything that you would like to see, questions that you would like you to know, we're wide open to that and we'd love to continue evaluating and just continue evaluating and continue the conversation going forward. So with that, thank you all. Thanks, everybody for joining. Thank you team for joining us. It's always a pleasure chatting with you guys. So that's where I'll leave it. If you have any last words, you have another event that you'd like to invite us to, let us know.\n\n  \nJohn Nahas (57:40): I did wrap up the last broadcast by inviting everyone to the Summit so I wish we had another summit coming up right away or else I would. But we actually will be doing a pretty big activation in July around the Formula E race in New York. It'll be in Brooklyn. We are New York-based. We're Brooklyn-based, so we will be doing some really cool activations around that date so stay tuned for an Avalanche House in July in New York. Hope to see you all there. Thanks, James.\n\n  \nJim Trautman (58:07): Awesome. Thank you, guys. Take care\n\n  \nNick Mussallem (58:09): Great.

Cleverly named after the mathematical notation, the hybrid-decentralized exchange offers perpetual futures contracts similar to the ones found on Binance, FTX, and other centralized exchanges. The protocol\u2019s ultimate goal is to build a fully decentralized derivatives exchange where no single party, including the team itself, can claim authority over the protocol\u2019s fundamental operations.\n\ndYdX was founded by Antonio Juliano, an ex-Coinbase engineer, who began working on the idea in the summer of 2017. The protocol\u2019s first two products, Expo and Solo, were built for margin trading on Ethereum. After seeing the explosion of perpetuals trading on Bitmex in 2019, dYdX decided to become the first DeFi protocol to trade perpetuals. The launch of perpetuals for major tokens like BTC and ETH quickly grew in popularity among traders seeking to use margin. Ease of use was later further improved with the addition of StarkEx layer-2 rollups in 2021. In hindsight, it is quite clear that dYdX\u2019s shift to perpetuals has paid off \u2014 the protocol has retained its status as the leading DeFi derivatives exchange.\n\nDuring Q4 2021, the dYdX community lowered market maker thresholds and increased staking rewards for the protocol\u2019s native DYDX token (stkDYDX). Additionally, the dYdX Foundation rolled out a mobile app in beta on iOS; started Trading Leagues, an open-ended trading competition; launched public trader profiles; and unveiled Hedgies, an NFT collection.\n\nMacro Overview\n\nAt the end of Q1 2022, dYdX operated 33 markets, ranging from layer-1s networks to blue-chip Ethereum DeFi tokens. Just like centralized derivatives exchanges, BTC and ETH comprise the majority of trading volume at 45.8% and 39.6%, respectively. The high trading volume of BTC and ETH, consequently, also makes it the highest source of fee revenue for the protocol.\n\nFee revenues are earned by the protocol as a percentage of each trade. Just recently, on April 19th, the protocol ended a temporary fee holiday where those fees were reduced by up to 66%. In our analysis, it\u2019s worth noting derivative exchanges operate with more capital efficiency since most trades are leveraged and fees are taken on each trade\u2019s notional size. A protocol like dYdX can stretch their revenue per dollar of collateral metric further than other DeFi business models. For example, comparing Q1 revenue-to-TVL ratios for dYdX and Uniswap shows the former calculating out to $0.14 per dollar and the latter achieving a fraction of that at $0.02 per dollar.\n\nTraders are incentivized to use the protocol through a Trader Rewards program. The mechanism distributes 3,835,616 native DYDX tokens each epoch (which lasts 28 days), to participants who have paid fees or hold positions in active contracts. A special formula is used to determine how those tokens are distributed to qualifying users. The rewards program is scheduled to last five years and is designed to boost trading volume on dYdX.\n\nWith that in perspective, dYdX facilitated $191.3 billion of trading volume in Q1 2022. The number was 23.8% lower than the total volume seen in Q4 2021. One big reason was the change of sentiment around crypto markets. In Q4, BTC and ETH both hit all-time-highs, and NFTs saw a resurgence in popularity. As a result, trading activity increased across the ecosystem, and dYdX was no exception. Interest in crypto was bound to revert back to the mean, bringing total dYdX volumes down with it.\n\nFurther trading behavior was analyzed in a recent report by Max Holloway and the team at Xenophon Labs. The team concluded that in the current rewards mechanism, traders are incentivized to maximize rewards by making trades at the end of each epoch. Making those trades towards the end provides two things: (1) traders receive their rewards shortly after making their trades, and (2) traders can better quantify the value of expected rewards.\n\nA quick glance at the chart above superficially supports that data. Every four weeks, there is the occasional week of high volume as each epoch ends. However, incentivized activity is common with DeFi protocols, and it\u2019s possible trading levels would be more evenly distributed if the rewards program was removed. Debates within governance have also taken place to determine if the rewards program should be adjusted to measure activity on a daily basis instead of by each epoch. Support was garnered from the community but no action has taken place to change the distribution of rewards.\n\nNew depositors, a proxy for new accounts, have decreased significantly since a hot Q3 2021. The metric declined 22.6% in Q1 after declining 75.3% in Q4 2021. A total of 4,894 deposits were made in Q1, bringing the total depositor count over the last year to 50,541. Although the slowdown of new accounts may seem like a challenge, the number of dYdX traders is naturally lower than spot-based DEXs because trading on leverage can be too risky for the average investor.\n\nThe weekly trader count had a positive trend throughout the quarter. Even excluding the global minimum for the first week of January (ending January 2), weekly trader counts went from 2,838 to 3,345 with a high of 4,344 traders in the second-to-last week. The most significant weekly decline occurred for the week ending March 6, which was a chaotic week for markets in general following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nOpen interest is a measure of the number of open contracts held by traders. When traders open a position, the total open interest number increases; when they close out of a contract, the open interest count decreases. The metric is commonly used as an indicator to confirm trends in markets.\n\nOpen interest edged upwards this past quarter to end at $1.3 billion. That value includes both long and short positions. Although it is difficult to glean direct information purely from open interest, The rise in open interest this past quarter could be a sign that speculators are re-entering the market after the previous quarter\u2019s slowdown.\n\nPerpetuals Market Spotlight\n\nThe first version of dYdX\u2019s perpetuals product started with three markets: Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Chainlink. Over the following two years, dYdX expanded to 33 markets supporting a variety of widely traded tokens, with an emphasis on blue-chip Layer-1s and DeFi protocols. This report focuses on the markets with the highest Q1 volume: BTC-USD, ETH-USD, and AVAX-USD.\n\nBTC-USD\n\nBTC-USD was the first market available through dYdX and is still widely traded. Total volume in Q1 was $87.6 billion, which was 20.8% lower than the previous quarter. The decline in trading volume is in line with the decline in overall trading volume for the protocol. However, in Q1, the trading volume of BTC perpetuals surpassed 2 million BTC tokens for the first time in a single quarter.\n\nAfter comparing BTC trading activity on the protocol to the same activity on several centralized exchanges (FTX, Binance, Deribit, OKX, Bybit, BitMEX, and Bitfinex), the results showed that dYdX should be considered a serious competitor in the ecosystem. The protocol facilitated $87.6 billion in trades in the BTC perpetuals market, nearly the same amount as that of established exchanges such as Deribit and BitMEX.\n\nBitcoin open interest hit an all-time high in Q3 2021 amidst a frantic bull market. Many traders opened new contracts to gain margined exposure to the price movement. The count of outstanding tokens rose from just over 1,000 to an all-time high of 8,348 on October 19, 2021. Open interest then decreased in Q4, bottoming out at 4,620 tokens before finishing this past quarter about halfway between the local maximum and minimum at 6,547.\n\nDaily bitcoin liquidations peaked on March 27 at $23.6 million. This particular day was notable as bitcoin returned to its breakeven price on the year and reached as high as $47,000 on the market. The token price increased 4.4% on the day, fueled by the $125 million purchase of BTC by the Luna Foundation Guard. Such a sudden intraday jump likely triggered a large number of liquidations by those who were holding short positions. The following day\u2019s price was also particularly high, ranking as the fourth-highest day of liquidated contracts in the quarter.\n\nETH-USD\n\nCumulative ETH trading volume for the quarter fell to $75.7 billion. The largest trading day occurred on March 14 while the lowest volume day fell on January 30. The daily range for the quarter fell between $255,000 to $2.3 billion, which is a 10x range between the high and the low. This wide range ultimately rests outside of the control of the protocol and more on larger economic events driving high-volume or low-volume trading days.\n\ndYdX held a strong market share in comparison to centralized exchanges in the ETH market. Out of the seven other exchanges, dYdX volumes came in third behind Binance and FTX, which remain the undisputed leaders of perpetuals trading. Nonetheless, adoption metrics highlight how valuable the DYDX token airdrop was to usage; dYdX activity as a percentage of centralized exchange volumes soared from a few basis points to single-digits immediately after the airdrop.\n\nETH\u2019s open interest declined throughout Q4 but is now seeing an upward trajectory heading into Q2 2022. A closer look at the metric shows open interest increasing when ETH fell to $2,500, then decreasing when ETH hit the $3,000 range. It then proceeded to rise again when ETH dipped into the mid-$2000s before flatlining as ETH settled into a range right before the end of the quarter. The overall movement of ETH open interest follows closely with BTC open interest as a strong correlation between the two assets continues to persist.\n\nThe highest daily liquidations for ETH this quarter all took place in the first few weeks of January. This came at a time when the market was reversing many of the gains earned in Q4 2021. On January 21, the ETH market saw its highest day of liquidations in the quarter. Not surprisingly, the day was brutal in the markets; the price of ETH dropped low/mid-double-digit percentages from the previous day. Notably, $13.5 billion of open contracts were liquidated after those holding the position failed to maintain the margin ratio.\n\nAVAX-USD\n\nOne reason for dYdX\u2019s relative strength in AVAX trading compared to BTC or ETH is its position as a DeFi-native exchange. The protocol facilitated $4.6B worth of AVAX trades in Q1 while centralized competitors such as Bybit, BitMEX, Bitfinex, and Deribit only achieved 10% or less of the same volume. The only exchanges which outpaced dYdX were FTX and Binance at $20.0 billion and $59.0 billion, respectively.\n\nAVAX open interest has been on the rise since August 2021 when the Avalanche network attracted attention as a popular, fast, cheap EVM-enabled network. As a result, in Q1 2022, open interest increased by 31.3%, going from 487,000 to 640,000 outstanding perpetual contracts. All of this occurred behind the backdrop of falling and then flattening AVAX token prices; the combination of falling AVAX prices but increased open interest could be read as a signal for increased investor interest in the blockchain network as a serious bet on the future.\n\nLiquidations within the quarter amounted to $21.3 million. Peak liquidations were dispersed fairly evenly throughout the three months as the token underwent higher volatility relative to ETH and BTC. AVAX began the quarter priced above $110 and fell to a low point below $70 before bouncing back. The day with the most liquidations was January 7.\n\nTrading Leagues, Profiles, and Hedgies\n\nIn an effort to continue attracting users, the dYdX announced a few new features to help gamify the trading experience. First, dYdX announced the creation of Trading Leagues in January. The leagues are a first-of-its-kind trading competition designed to boost volume by offering weekly prizes to the highest-performing traders. Prices are given out weekly (which dYdX refers to as a trading season) and vary depending on the specific league tier. Weekly cash prizes can approach $350,000. Users move between leagues according to their weekly performance. Think of the system like the one used for European soccer: the fear of relegation further incentivizes players to do well!\n\nIn conjunction with Trading Leagues, users are now able to create personal profiles. Other parties can select an individual profile and view the 30-day historical performance of that trader\u2019s portfolio.\n\nHedgies were also introduced as NFT avatars for personal profiles. A collection of 4,200 unique NFTs was distributed on Ethereum starting February 1, 2022. Hedgies did not come with a mint cost; the only price to pay was gas fees. Subsequent mints beginning February 8 were given at the end of each trading season to the most profitable traders.\n\nSource: Hedgies\n\nBeyond their status as avatars, Hedgies come with practical utility. Holders of the NFT benefit from reduced fees on the dYdX protocol. Owning Hedgies increases the trader\u2019s fee tier by one category. Since a higher fee tier (associated with a higher balance) decreases one\u2019s trading fees, acquiring a Hedgie effectively increases capital efficiency for traders.\n\nGovernance Update\n\nA few major governance proposals were active in the most recent quarter. As dYdX proceeds toward complete decentralization, governance will take on increasing importance in the management of the protocol.\n\nJanuary 7, 2022 - dYdX Grants Program\n\nReverie, a consultancy for DAOs, proposed to launch and manage a $6.25 million dYdX Grant Program (DGP). After passing the on-chain vote with unanimous support, 752,000 DYDX were moved from the Community Treasury to the Grants Multisignature Wallet (Multisig). As one of the largest community grant programs in DeFi, DGP increases the number of active contributors working on development, marketing, education, and other value accretive activities. The Grants Committee reviews all applications and controls the DGP Multisig.\n\nFebruary 1, 2022 - Liquidity Staking Pool Borrowing Requirements Framework\n\nThe Liquidity Staking Pool allows users to stake USDC for DYDX. The staked USDC is an interest-free, uncollateralized loan to pre-approved market makers, only to be used to provide liquidity to dYdX order books. While stakers do earn DYDX, they also incur counterparty risk, namely that a market maker won\u2019t be able to pay back its loan.\n\nTo help add new, reliable, and creditworthy liquidity providers to the Liquidity Provider pool, the dYdX Foundation created a set of borrowing requirements. By passing the proposal with near-unanimous support, DYDX tokenholders, who still get the final say on who borrows staked USDC, agreed to use the framework to select borrowers. Under this new framework, prospective borrowers must qualify for Liquidity Provider Rewards in the preceding epoch (by providing more than 0.25% of maker volume), and create a public profile on the dYdX community forum with all the relevant disclosures, and agree to the revolving credit agreement.\n\nFebruary 12, 2022 - Reduce the threshold for receiving liquidity provider rewards to 0.25%\n\nThe dYdX Liquidity Provider Rewards program incentivizes market liquidity by giving DYDX to certain liquidity providers. This proposal, passed with almost unanimous support, lowered the minimum maker volume threshold required to start earning these rewards from 1% to 0.25%. This change bolsters liquidity by attracting more active capital from smaller, yet still consequential, market makers.\n\nMarch 21, 2022 - Implement a Guernsey Purpose Trust for the dYdX Grants Program\n\nReverie\u2019s proposal to implement a Guernsey purpose trust for the dYdX Grant Program passed with near unanimity. As a result, the committee and Multisig will turn into a Guernsey purpose trust structure: committee members will be trustees; multisig assets will become the purpose trust, and Reverie will be the enforcer. While maintaining the same level of tokenholder control, this new structure simultaneously increases functionality and reduces risk. Some benefits include allowing the conversion of DYDX to USDC (for grants) without tax liabilities, enabling off-chain agreements, and reducing legal liabilities for all parties.\n\ndYdX Grant Program Updates\n\nSince launching DGP at the beginning of the quarter (January 10, 2022), the program has pledged more than $2 million in grants. A few notable grants are listed below:\n\nApproved:\n\nTrading Strategy Bot: Bayswater Capital, a boutique investment bank based in South Africa, will build an open-source trading bot. Any dYdX trader, regardless of location, will be able to use the bot locally through a GitHub repo.\n\nTooling Page: Chaos Labs, a protocol security platform, will build a comprehensive webpage that includes funding rates (dYdX perpetual premiums), a rewards simulator to estimate trading rewards, and a command-line interface (CLI) trading tool.\n\nIn Progress:\n\nBlockcrunch Podcast Sponsorship: Starting this month (April 2022), dYdX will become the primary sponsor of the Blockcrunch podcast for the next six months. Included in the sponsorship are brand shoutouts and commissioned guest episodes with members of the dYdX.\n\nCompleted:\n\nLiquidation Alert Tool: A self-hosted tool that alerts users in their email, Discord, Slack, or Telegram when any of their dYdX positions are close to liquidation. The bot was built by Max Holloway.\n\nDAO Organizational Structure Research: Davincifi received a grant to produce a research report examining the history of collective coordination and governance to provide actionable insights to dYdX. The complete report was published on Davincifi\u2019s Substack and can be found here. Key takeaways from the report include investing in non-technical contributors, reducing the number of decision-makers whenever possible, and encouraging more participation from those contributing on the periphery of the ecosystem.\n\nRoadmap\n\nThe biggest event on the horizon is the launch of dYdX V4. While V4 development is ongoing, the protocol also launched a new mobile app for on-the-go trading.\n\ndYdX V4\n\nAt the beginning of Q1, dYdX Trading Inc. announced its plan to fully decentralize the dYdX protocol by the end of 2022. Right now, dYdX uses the StarkEx L2 as a settlement layer, but dYdX Trading Inc. runs an off-chain order book and matching engine on centralized servers and collects all trading fees. With dYdX V4, the matching engine and order book will be fully decentralized, and dYdX Trading Inc. will not control any part of the protocol or directly collect any trading fees. While dYdX Trading Inc. will continue to develop open-source software and support the protocol\u2019s growth, aspects formerly under its purview such as market creation will be handed over to protocol governance (DYDX tokenholders).\n\nV4 might also move beyond perpetuals and support other trading products (i.e., spot, margin, synthetics, etc.), expand and improve choices around margin and collateral, build rails to support permissionless market creation, and bring improvements to trading and market structure.\n\nDue to potential constraints around throughput, finality, and fairness (frontrunning) this transition will be challenging. However, if executed, the step change in transparent, permissionless, high-performance trading and market creation will be monumental.\n\ndYdX iOS app\n\nIn early March, dYdX became one of the first DeFi protocols to launch a native mobile application, albeit in a public beta. Onboarding through the priority waitlist was contingent on holding more than 10 DYDX or one Hedgie and doing greater than $1,000 in trade volume between March 9 and March 23. Additionally, eager beta testers can still join the referral waitlist by participating in social campaigns through Reddit, Twitter, etc. Once the app does publicly launch, all dYdX users will be able to trade and monitor positions on the go like they can with centralized exchanges (e.g., FTX, Binance, etc.) today.\n\nConclusion\n\nAcross the crypto derivatives market, there are two main types of exchanges: centralized exchanges and decentralized exchanges. Centralized exchanges typically have more resources but are hampered by regulations, marred by transparency concerns, and need to be trusted by users. Meanwhile, decentralized exchanges such as dYdX have fewer resources but offer solutions to the problems centralized exchanges face.\n\nFor dYdX, the belief that decentralized services will capture more of the market share in light of their advantages is backed by the work the team is doing. With a clear roadmap towards full decentralization and competitive trading volume, the protocol remains a formidable participant leading DeFi\u2019s alternative derivatives exchanges.\n\nThis report was commissioned by the dYdX Grants Program, a member of Protocol Services.

Voting is currently active.  \n\nSector Returns\n\nThis week saw some of the least volatile trading within the crypto markets for quite some time. Patterns like this resemble a consolidation phase, which indicates that the markets could be getting ready to make significant moves in the near term. Most top assets on the sectors covered traded within single-digit ranges for the week. However, most sectors had one or two outliers that broke the trend and rallied into the double-digit gains. The currencies sector came out on top this week, gaining 1.20% while gaming fell behind with -3.4%.\n\nTop Assets\n\nThe top assets by market capitalization category showed a mixed set of returns. Half of the assets yielded negative returns, while the other half ended the week on the green. However, Terra (LUNA) stood out as the only asset within the category to finish the week with a double-digit positive return. The Cosmos-based IBC chain\u2019s native asset LUNA rose in price up to 22% before shedding almost half of it, ending the week with an 11.8% gain. Dogecoin (DOGE) took last place among top assets with -4.7% for the week.\n\nDeFi Assets\n\nDeFi was another sector with mixed returns. Four of the top ten DeFi assets closed the week with single-digit losses while the rest ended in the green. Of the six assets that had positive returns, two of them clearly dominated this week. 0x Protocol stole the spotlight following the announcement that Coinbase will be leveraging the decentralized exchange infrastructure protocol to power their upcoming NFT marketplace. The 0x token\u2019s price spiked to as high as 55% on the week but has been on a continuous downtrend since reaching the weekly top. It finished the week on the top-performing asset covered with a 26.9% gain. Next up was PancakeSwap, ending the week with a 13.5% return.\n\nSmart Contract Platforms\n\nThe smart contract platform sector traded with high synchrony for the entire week with the exception of two assets \u2014 TRON (TRX) and Terra (LUNA). While the rest of the assets traded within single-digit range, the two assets broke away from the pack in the second half of the week. After over a 30% drop from its all-time-high, LUNA has managed to bounce back, securing an 11.8% return on the week. On the other hand, the unexpected rally of TRON (TRX) happened after Justin Sun announced that TRON will launch its own native algorithmic stablecoin \u2014 USDD. According to the news, it will feature a similar mechanism to UST in order to keep its peg and boast a 30% APY. The TRX token spiked 19% following the news and closed the week with an 18.5% gain.\n\nCurrencies\n\nClosely resembling how the smart contract platform sector traded, currencies also traded in close synchrony and within a single-digit channel with the exception of two outliers \u2014 privacy coins. The two outperforming currencies this week were Monero (XMR) and Zcash (ZEC). Monero (XMR) broke from the pack mid week and propelled itself to a 21.8% gain on the week. Zcash (ZEC) followed suit but to a lesser extent. It ended the week with a 10.5% return.\n\nWeb3\n\nThe Web3 sector had a more volatile week compared to the other sectors. Most tokens traded at their own trend, and returns were quite varied with four of the ten assets finishing the week with positive returns. Among those assets, Livepeer was the one to take the lead for the week. The decentralized video infrastructure protocol\u2019s token saw its price finish the week with a 7.6% return. On the other hand, Helium was the laggard of the group as it posted an 11.1% loss for the week.\n\nGaming\n\nThe gaming sector took a last second dip as some of the tokens dropped by as much as 10% in a short period of time. The dip was enough to drag most of the top assets within the sector underwater. Alice (ALICE) was the only one to finish the week on green territory by a small margin (1.4%). Yield Guild Games secured the endmost position of the group as it secured an 11.3% decline for the week.\n\n", "references": [{"name": "Guillermo Avil\u00e9s", "url": ""}], "published_at": "2022-04-22T06:31:00Z", "author": {"name": "Guillermo Avil\u00e9s"}, "tags": ["Macro"], "url": "https://messari.io/article/weekly-recap-ending-april-21"}, {"id": "f6a82fd8-cfef-490c-a3b8-224ff7136808", "title": "State of Uniswap Q1 Analyst Call Transcript", "content": "If you would like to view the full recording of the live Crowdfest event, you can find it on our YouTube channel. You can also read the full Quarterly Report by Jerry Sun here.\n\nParticipants:\n\nJerry Sun - Messari research analyst\nFederico Landini - Uniswap Grants Program\nBoris Stanic - Uniswap Grants Program\nYj - Uniswap Grants Program\n\nJerry Sun (0:07): We\u2019re at the top of the hour here, so let\u2019s get started. I think a round of introductions would be welcome. I\u2019m sure many in the Uniswap community know who you guys are, either through discord or the grants program, but I think for anyone on the call who doesn\u2019t, I\u2019m sure that would be helpful. Happy to pass it to you guys first, and then I can go after you guys. Any of you guys want to get us started?\n\n  \nBoris Stanic (0:34): I\u2019ll go first. So when we do interviews for the grants program, one of us usually introduces all of us, since we basically all do the same thing but maybe we switch it up for this time. So, my name is Boris, I\u2019m part of the Uniswap Grants Program (UGP) and Uniswap community. For the past almost a year now, its my workaversary or DAOversary soon. What I do is review the grant applications, I host the Uniswap community calls every two weeks, and then we make sure that the grants that we support actually turn out successful \u2013 so connecting them with the right people, funding them, trying to break the barriers in front of them, basically. That\u2019s us and myself together, so yea!\n\n  \nJerry Sun (1:42): Nice to have you, Boris!\n\n  \nFederico Landini (1:46): I will go, then Yj. Hi everybody, my name is Fede and I\u2019m also part of the Uniswap Grants Program. I was a grantee, I started as a grantee, so I applied to the Uniswap Grants Program to develop a simulator to simulate Uniswap V3 strategies. I got funds and I got involved in the community, and three months ago I joined the team with Yj, Ken and Boris, and we review all together other applications and we follow up grants and help people to develop tools that help the Uniswap community.\n\n  \nYj (2:24): I\u2019m Yj and I\u2019m also one of the reviewers for the Uniswap Grants Program. I first started getting involved with Uniswap staff and helping out with more difficult user tech support on Discord. I also help kind of keep an eye on some other channels, like the international community on the Discord server, for example a Chinese channel, Japanese channel, Indonesian channel. And then about six months ago now, I started helping Boris and Ken, and later on Fede as well, with reviews on grants. Then most recently, Fede and I started the Uniswap grants Community Analytics Program, which we are running right now with data analytics bounties for various topics to encourage the open sharing of crypto and Uniswap analytics for the community, so that\u2019s me.\n\n  \nJerry Sun (3:19): Awesome, welcome everyone! My name is Jerry, I\u2019m a research analyst on the Messari team, I\u2019m based out of San Francisco here, and I wrote the Q1 quarterly report that we\u2019ll be spending some time talking about today. I also wrote the Q4 quarterly report, so I\u2019m fairly familiar with the contents of both reports, and happy to talk about some of the quarter-over-quarter changes that we saw. I think we can get started and dive into the report here. This is where I want to try to share my screen and we\u2019ll see if I\u2019m able to make this work here.\n\n  \nJerry Sun (4:41): So we got the report pulled up, this is the State of Uniswap Q1 2022. I just want to pull this up because one of the things I want to add as a quick disclaimer before we start is that traditionally in our reports, we host them on our website, messari.io, and for the quarterly reports we decided to go and covert all of them to PDF as well. We think that, just in general, PDFs are an easy way for distribution and we want to make sure that everyone in the community has an opportunity to go and read the report, to go and distribute and send to their friends for example. Ethan\u2019s got it pulled up there, and if you guys want to pull it up or check it out, it\u2019s available on the website and I think we have it linked in the chat bar to the right, at the very top. So diving into the report here, I\u2019ve actually got a presentation that I\u2019ve wanted to pull up. We can start with talking a little bit about the macro, so the key metric summary is the table that we\u2019ll want to talk about here. To give a quick overview from a high level of Uniswap and how it performed in Q1, I would say that Q1 was a very different quarter relative to Q4. There we a lot of catalysts for Q4, you think about the rise of NFTs at the beginning of Q4, bitcoin and ether hit all-time highs during that quarter, and all of that activity clearly benefits Uniswap because it encourages a lot of people to go to the DEX to make trades, it encourages trading activity. Q1, in contrast, was a little bit more of a pullback, what I would consider a reversion back to the mean, and so we did see some quarter-over-quarter decreases in total volume, in liquidity, in trading fees, things like that. One important caveat to note, though, is that this is all priced in USD equivalent denominations, so obviously even if the price of bitcoin, ether, and all these crypto tokens is decreasing, that\u2019s going to affect some of the metrics here as well. For you guys on this panel, personally, when you think about Uniswap and the health of the protocol, what are important metrics that you guys look at? What are the best ways to think about how to analyze Uniswap?\n\n  \nFederico Landini (8:33): I personally do believe to have a look at the relative performance of Uniswap compared to the other DEXs, so as you say in the last quarter Q1 that the market was quite, not as exciting let\u2019s say as it was in Q4, but if you check the dominance or the performance of Uniswap compared to other AMMs and other DEXs, Uniswap was quite consistently the top DEX also in Q1. I think that\u2019s a good sign of strength and health of the protocol.\n\n  \nBoris Stanic (9:13): Maybe I\u2019ll share my thoughts, so trading volumes and numbers don\u2019t really interest that much because it all has to do with how much crypto in general is getting traction and interest among people. As long as I see that projects are launching on top of Uniswap \u2014 for example as soon as they launch a token, there\u2019s a Uniswap pool which has a lot of activity and there are also liquidity mining incentives, and they\u2019re using Uniswap for what it was built for \u2014 that\u2019s exactly what Uniswap as a protocol needs. It\u2019s being used, and now the volumes at which it\u2019s being used just has to do with the whole cryptocurrency scene and market in general, and you can\u2019t affect it that much as a DEX or as a protocol.\n\n  \nYj (10:18): Yeah, I feel the same way in the sense that one of the things I raised when looking at the reports is that if you talk about volume reducing, we normally use the USD equivalent, so if crypto as a whole drops from one quarter to the next then you expect USD equivalent volume to just drop. So, fair dimension comparing against other DEXs and other protocols is key. The other thing to consider would be comparing against centralized exchanges because it\u2019s all part of price fighting, and Uniswap\u2019s mechanism relies on arbitrage to do the price finding, so when we compare against Coinbase and others, what does that show? Then also another very important thing for V3 especially is, of course, the capital efficiency, concentrated liquidity from the perspective of both liquidity providers in terms of earning fees and also swappers in terms of getting the best execution price, including any fee they\u2019re night need to pay on other protocols or centralized exchanges. Does Uniswap give the best value? I think those are the type of comparative metrics that I personally am most interested in.\n\n  \nJerry Sun (11:36): Right, I think those great points that you make and Yj just to supplement what you\u2019re saying, there\u2019s not a lot Uniswap can do as an individual protocol relative to the broader crypto economy, your metrics are just going to fluctuate just depending on how crypto does in general for the quarter. Just to back that up with some numbers, and Yj pointed this out earlier, that crypto as an entire ecosystem went from $3T in Q4 to $2T at the end of Q1. So that is almost a 50% decrease in terms of how the size of the economy shrank, but when you look at some of these metrics, I think Uniswap actually showed its resiliency because volume only decreased 20%. So what does that mean? It means that if you convert the USD equivalent, Uniswap probably did just as well or maybe even slightly better in Q1 than it did in the previous quarter. There\u2019s probably a continued growth of users, of trades, and I think those are all positive signs. I don\u2019t know if you guys all saw this, but on Twitter, Coinbase announced a bunch of new tokens that they want to list and it\u2019s a lot of stuff that people don\u2019t necessarily know. Some of them people do and a decent number of them people did not know, and that\u2019s something I\u2019ve been thinking about because it seems like they\u2019re trying to compete with Uniswap because it\u2019s so easy to go and list a token on Uniswap. Once you have an airdrop or whatever it\u2019s immediately on there, whereas with Coinbase it\u2019s just so much harder to do that, but they\u2019re trying to list as many tokens as they can. That\u2019s gonna be an advantage that Uniswap will probably have over centralized exchanges. I think you guys made great points and the way you guys think about Uniswap is something I definitely agree with, a very holistic picture.\n\nWe can jump now to the next slide, and I want to talk about the growth of Polygon. This is a graph we\u2019ve included in the report, but on the left side of this chart here, you got to see some of the scaling solutions start to take place in terms of liquidity. It\u2019s still very dominated by Ethereum, which is the dark and light blue shading, which represents V2 and V3, but one of the biggest winners of Q1 was Polygon. Their growth was very organic, there weren\u2019t any liquidity mining incentives that went live in Q1, they I believe are live now for the first week of April. When Polygon says they\u2019re going to institute liquidity mining, my question for you guys is does Uniswap or do people in the community have any sort of interaction with the Polygon team? How do people hold them to it to make sure that gets implemented?\n\n  \nBoris Stanic (15:42): Maybe I\u2019ll answer this one since I was the most involved. I tweeted out a small thread about 100 days after the proposal passed and there wasn\u2019t too much news about the liquidity mining incentives, but I wasn\u2019t paying enough attention so that\u2019s a mistake on my part. There was actually a developer from Polygon who was updating people but I didn\u2019t follow him so I didn\u2019t see this. Polygon main accounts are just too busy always updating us on the things that are actually launching, so they don\u2019t update people on things they\u2019re working on because they\u2019re constantly launching something. To your question, we do not have a say in how liquidity mining incentives will look on Polygon, it\u2019s completely organized by the Polygon team. As to how we will hold them accountable to make sure these promises are fulfilled, the Polygon team is a highly respectful one and even though it\u2019s not common in crypto, we trusted that they will. There wasn\u2019t a trustless process, so they said there would be up to $15M in liquidity mining incentives and we said, \u201cYea sure! That sounds good.\u201d If some time passed and if they didn\u2019t do anything, we wouldn\u2019t be able to do anything as well, but I know the other internet research group that\u2019s being supported by the Uniswap Grants Program is actually researching how we can make this trustless. If someone claims that they will do something if a proposal passes, what kind of mechanics can we implement so this becomes a trustless process and it gets executed automatically? Hopefully I didn\u2019t miss any of your questions.\n\n  \nJerry Sun (18:06): No, I think that\u2019s great. In the governance proposal for Polygon, and the way you phrased it as well, you know it\u2019s phrased as \u201cwe\u2019re going to give up to $15M of liquidity mining incentives and up to $5M to support the ecosystem around V3 on Polygon.\u201d I saw recently through the live liquidity mining that right now they've set aside $3M through a third-party, and what I\u2019m curious about is if that\u2019s what traditionally occurs when they say we\u2019re gonna give \u201cup to 15\u201d but then they set aside $3M? Also, is it common to use a third-party, I think they used Iracus Finance, to go and set that up? Are those things you traditionally see?\n\n  \nBoris Stanic (19:07): I think this was the first time in history, at least of Uniswap, that somebody promised something and then liquidity mining incentives happened. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a usual case for it or am I missing something? Do you have any other examples of this kind of deal happening?\n\n  \nFederico Landini (19:41): I don\u2019t think it\u2019s happened in the Uniswap ecosystem, and as Boris was saying, it\u2019s probably an area of improvement where governance has to figure out how to make sure these agreements are followed up on. I think it\u2019s an area that\u2019s interesting, but in this case it was the first time so maybe it was not perfect but in the end it came through.\n\n  \nJerry Sun (20:23): Right, and to summarize here, Polygon has had organic growth even without the liquidity mining. They\u2019ve been the fastest rising in terms of growth relative to time out of the non-Ethereum scaling solutions for V3, so they\u2019ve done a tremendous job.\n\n  \nFederico Landrini (20:47): As we said at the beginning, we are running a Uniswap analytics program, and one of the bounties that we published was exactly about the growth of Uniswap on Polygon. We got some really great dashboards from the community that show how fast Uniswap was able to affirm itself on Polygon, and in less than a month it became the biggest DEX on Polygon without liquidity mining incentives. I think this is a very interesting data point that our analyst in the community pointed out.\n\n  \nJerry Sun (21:27): Right, and the Polygon community is just, in general, very big too, so I think there\u2019s a lot of market capture opportunity for Uniswap.\n\n  \nYj (21:39): Yeah, that\u2019s what I was going to say. I think part of this is dependent on how much ERC-20s have already been bridged over from Mainnet to Polygon prior to the Uniswap V3 launch, following the successful governance proposal. The different scaling solutions all went online onto Mainnet at different times, and then on each of them, they are different major and maybe chain-exclusive projects that launch on them. Some of them, like Polygon, I haven\u2019t really looked into the data yet and maybe this is one analysis that would be interesting to look at, but they might have already had a lot of projects and tokens being bridged over or launched natively or exclusively for Polygon. So when Uniswap is there, there\u2019s a lot more tokens available for liquidity and swapping. That\u2019s maybe a gut feeling on my end, since I haven\u2019t looked at the data. Then in terms of the liquidity mining promise, it\u2019s going to be very difficult as a community and grants program to encourage more trustless tooling and processes to make everything smoother and better. But if you think about it, when the Polygon governance proposal was put out, there was never any cross-chain governance process or tooling at all, so it had to be a trust-based thing. When they, \u201cwe will launch on Polygon,\u201d at the time, Uniswap Labs had to work with them to launch it and put in the rails to make sure everything works. Since then, things have been happening and UGP actually funded GFX Labs to start researching cross-chain governance for Uniswap, and that resulted in a successful test case activation of one of the basis point pools on Polygon, just a few days ago. Hoping that as a grants program, we can encourage more and more of this type of research and tooling development to make things move towards full trustlessness.\n\n  \nBoris Stanic (24:05): Can I just share one thing when it comes to L2 solutions that I think might be important?\n\n  \nJerry Sun (24:13): Yeah, absolutely.\n\n  \nBoris Stanic (24:15): So we have a graph here of liquidity and I don't think that liquidity and volume, in terms of numbers, is as important as a number of unique addresses that interacted on the certain L2 solution. Big whales and big traders will always prefer the security of a main chain and liquidity of a main chain over trusting some L2 solution because the safest chain is the Ethereum chain. But what happens on the main chain is that smaller traders get priced out by gas and here is where L2 solutions come into play and they make it so that you can still do trustless swaps in a fully decentralized way, well not fully but as far as it currently goes. It just opens the door for smaller traders to enter the scene and invest in the tokens and swap tokens that they like, so that's what's one point that I want to share.\n\n  \nJerry Sun (25:32): Right, I think that's a great point. I guess Boris, to add on to what you're saying, one reason why, in my opinion, Polygon has really taken off is that it\u2019s just seen as a side chain. It's very easy to bridge between Polygon and Ethereum, but you go to something like Optimism, optimistic L2 rollups, and it's a little bit more difficult to move money back and forth, in terms of waiting periods and things like that. So I assume that when zk-rollups become live or you can launch smart contracts on zk-rollups, the governance community at Uniswap are probably gonna go and try to set that up as well, and we'll probably see some good organic growth from there too because again, like you said, there\u2019s cheaper costs but you don't have to worry about some of the the difficulties with using the optimistic rollups in that sense.\n\n  \nBoris Stanic (26:34): Yeah, definitely. The L2 scene is still developing and people put a lot of hope into zk-rollups to make it even better, but we'll have to wait and see. Ethereum as a chain is also progressing and will be able to sustain more transactions per second and the combination of these two things might make it so that we don't ever see $300 fees on Uniswap ever again. It will be something that we will tell kids about, you know, so the whole scene is just making it so that it can sustain higher throughput in a sustainable way, so not jeopardizing decentralization and security too much. That will enable lower fees, which will enable more people to actually use Uniswap as a dapp on those chains.\n\n  \nJerry Sun (27:52): Right, right. Yj you mentioned something that I thought was pretty interesting, which is the cross-chain governance proposal that's going on right now with Polygon. I talk about it in the report, but extremely successful, and I think a very good example of governance coming together and coming up with something that is really beneficial to everyone; to LPs, to people who want to make swaps on Uniswap. I think since its creation it\u2019s generated like $2.5M to $3M of fees for LPs, so that\u2019s a big win for everyone. I guess I'm kind of curious to hear your thought on this, because in terms of cross-chain governance, this is the first example of cross-chain governance, but in the future how do you envision cross-chain governance to play out? Do you think, \u201cright now it's live on Ethereum and then gets implemented on Polygon,\u201d do you think that will continue to be the case? Do you guys think it might be the other way around, where maybe you test something on Polygon if there's a little less activity you see if it works, and then you try it on Ethereum? Assuming cross-chain governance works, what are your takes on that?\n\n  \nYj (29:15): I think it's hard to say. It's still developing, it's so new. And just in governance in general, even voting mechanisms, are being changed all the time by different projects and people are still experimenting on it. The thing with Uniswap governance and the Uniswap protocol as a whole is the immutable nature of it. So as it stands now, that has been deployed without further governance proposals that get passed and executed. There is no simple way of doing more complex cross-chain stuff, so the Polygon one has to necessarily go from Mainnet onto Polygon because the $UNI token where voting power lies is on Mainnet Unisawap, right. And actually, in the previous community call that Boris hosted, we also quickly discussed this in terms of governance, the fact that $UNI token actually loses its voting power if it's bridged to other side chains or L2s, if you put it in LP, if you put it on lending protocol. We actually have a current live data bounty program asking the community to contribute to this, and to look into the extent of loss of $UNI voting power when you utilize it for other things. But going back to your original question, you were saying whether I personally see experimentation being done on L2s or chains before moving back, I mean as it stands that cannot happen, but that's not to say that it will not happen. I'm personally quite excited to see what people come up with to experiment on this, and actually Uniswap Grants Program is looking for people to submit applications to research and maybe prototype or test or experiment with all these. I think it will be pretty exciting to see, and of course with Uniswap continuing to get deployed on other chains, stuff like cross-chain processing mechanism will become more and more important, so I'm personally quite looking forward to seeing the new stuff that can come up from there.\n\n  \nJerry Sun (31:31): Right, definitely. Well, you know, you bring up the grants program, and you guys are exploring a lot of different ways to do some studies on how you can do governance with the $UNI token on other chains, and just other initiatives in general for the grants program. I want to talk about the grants program a little bit here, this is obviously your bread and butter, seeing all these proposals. The first question I have is a fun one for myself which is, when I go and DM the Uniswap Grants Program Twitter handle, which one of you guys is responding to me?\n\n  \nBoris Stanic (32:15): None of us, I think. We have a shadow writer.\n\n  \nJerry Sun (32:24): Well whoever that person is, I just wanted to say how very friendly and very helpful, so thank you. Thank that person, whoever it is.\n\n  \nBoris Stanic (32:35): I mean, I think you can deduce who it is. It\u2019s nobody in this chat.\n\n  \nJerry Sun (32:41): Right, of course. Well tell us a little about the grants program, how are decisions made in the grants program? In terms of deciding what projects or proposals get funded, is it a group decision? Do you guys each look at proposals individually? What is the structure of that?\n\n  \nYj (33:11): Boris you undertake this one?\n\n  \nBoris Stanic (33:14): Okay I'll do it since I think I\u2019ve spent the longest period of time as part of the grants program. Essentially, it is a group decision and a key question that we always ask ourselves when we look at the applications is: does this fall into the grand program scope? So the program was established by the governance to fund public goods and promote the protocol in the ecosystem, but promoting doesn't really mean marketing, at least that's what we believe. So when you look at the public goods, one key question that we ask ourselves and look for in the application is: will this happen if we don't intervene? So let's say somebody is making a for-profit project, and then a small part of that for-profit project touches Uniswap, and they would like us to fund development of the project for that part which touches Uniswap. The answer to the question, \u201cwill it happen if we don't fund it?\u201d is yes because they're building a whole project also and this key part will also be part of it. But on the other side, we have different SDKs, libraries, and things that wouldn't really exist or, even better, wouldn't exist in a humane way, because somebody would spend hours and hours developing it and making it great for the others to use and wouldn't get any kind of compensation for it. That\u2019s when we step in with our connections, so grantees have questions and we make sure that they get answers, and we also support them financially so that they don't work on these things for free. We have a small process, we do weekly sprints where we have two ongoing sprints at the same time, so we do interviews and then we do you know discussions and internal reviews. These are two separate sprints where, if the previous week was interviews, the current week is discussions, and we try to find more information if we need it. Then for the interviews, we just do the interviews and take notes so we can discuss it and do more research the next week. I think since Fede and Yj joined we\u2019ve had the just right amount of reviewers and people to not have an expanding backlog like we had before, so I think we're pretty up to date right now. But it's always a discussion and our working group trusts each other, so maybe if I personally don't see value in some proposal but Fede or Yj think that it's really good for the ecosystem, I will trust their call. Of course we are not perfect, we make mistakes and we try to correct those as well through some of the other grants that we do, such as Gitcoin, where we actually let the community decide how funds will be distributed. Hopefully that\u00a0 answers your question.\n\n  \nJerry Sun (37:45): Right, definitely. This is not the most direct comparison, I know there's some differences, but I think the grants program almost like you guys are investors and you're making investments not for for-profit businesses per se, and you're not looking for a direct financial return, but rather to grow the ecosystem to benefit the Uniswap protocol and the crypto community as a whole. So when investors give money to a project, typically they also get updates maybe once a month or once a quarter, as they want to know how their investment is doing, what have you guys done with this funding, and things like that. I know there's not always follow-ups in terms of governance, but with the grants program, if I want to come to you with a project for $25,000 and then you guys approve it, what goes after the approval process? Do you have check-ins with the proposer?\n\n  \nBoris Stanic (38:57): Somebody else should answer this, but yes, so maybe Yj they or Fede since you know the process.\n\n  \nFederico Landrini (39:03): Yes, we have continuous checks, monthly or bi-monthly depending on the project, to check the the status and to try to help the grantee as much as possible with our connection to the Uniswap Labs team or to other resources from other projects. As I shared at the beginning, I was a grantee myself so I went through this process and this is what made me more and more involved in the community, and at the end, ended up part of the grants program team itself. It's also an opportunity for the grantees to be involved more, to participate in hackathons, in presentations, really it's not only that they need to work on their project but it's being part of the community and helping each other to be successful in the end.\n\n  \nYj (39:53): Yeah, I think the distinction between VC investors and the grants program is an important one, in the sense that when we accept a grant application, we will ask for a sensible timeline and what the plan is. Then we put in sensible milestones for those check-ins and they don't have to be super straight in terms of deadlines or timing, but if we don't hear something back from a grantee, the main worry is that they are facing blockers that they cannot surpass. We are here to encourage people to work together in open-source ways and create public goods for the Uniswap ecosystem. So the worry is not so much about people running away with $5,000 or something, it's more about if there is something blocking you from achieving the aims of the grant that you applied for. So the check-in plays a role in that sense, to see how we can help, because as Fede said, they might need some input from the Labs team, they might need input from from other people within crypto, so we try to make those connections for them in order to maximize the return from grants. And, you know, Uniswap Grants Program was given a mandate to do so by community governance, so that's a bit of a difference.\n\n  \nJerry Sun (41:26): Right, that makes sense. From you all\u2019s perspective, what are some of the biggest challenges that you guys face when you go through proposals, when you accept proposals, and just managing the grants program? I've heard from people who are part of grants programs, and they always say it\u2019s a very time consuming job, it's a very extensive role. And you know, Fede, from what you're saying it sounds like you guys have check-ins, and if you guys have check-ins with I don't know how many grants you guys approve every week, I assume it's you know one or two or several maybe a week, that's a decent number of check-ins that you kind of continuously have to do every month or every two months. I'm just kind of curious, from your perspective, what are some of the blockers on your end if you guys have any?\n\n  \nFederico Landrini (42:28): Personally, I think the broadness of the space and the knowledge that you have to have to to judge some of the projects is the most difficult part for us, because as you know, crypto is a very very technical space, and we move from development to tokeneconomics to governance to analytics, so there is a very broad surface that we try to cover as much as possible, and when we cannot do it, we try to to get help in the community to get the knowledge that is required to understand the proposal.\n\n  \nJerry Sun (43:22): Gotcha. Do you guys have any sort of funding minimum or maximum for any of the proposals? I know that these are kind of arbitrary, these waves, they don't really correlate to any specific period of time, you just kind of batch them together. However, wave six is noticeably higher in terms of the funding than in previous waves, and a big part of that is due to the other internet funding. I think that was very significant, but just in terms of how much you're able to give, are there any sort of restrictions on your end?\n\n  \nBoris Stanic (44:07): There are no restrictions really, well other internet grant was really big, but it's actually delegated funding, so they will use those funds to fund more grants and research and different people, so it's not just a team where five or six of them get the whole million dollars. It will actually be sort of like a subDAO or committee, but they do great things in the research, so that's why we decided to support them. When we talk about minimums and maximums, there are no such things, but you\u2019re right, wave eight already exists but it wasn't announced so it's just an arbitrary amount of applications that we you know cut and then you say, \u201cokay this is a wave.\u201d Also some things that you'll probably see in the wave eight that we started doing recently are smaller grants, and we're open to having a smaller part especially when it comes to different events in different parts of the world and different communities. So for spoilers, in the wave eight you will see a lot of smaller grants that are targeting different events and communities across the world, and we think that that's a great way of just spreading the word of Uniswap and also helping these communities grow because, let's say $5,000 to some community event that is not in the most expensive part of the world will encourage more people than you would otherwise get. You will have a greater impact than spending $20,000 or $30,000 on a San Francisco event, so we are more open to sponsoring these smaller grants recently. Maybe something to add Yj?\n\n  \nYj (46:41): Yeah, I was going to say that in terms of the amounts, at the end of the day, the grants program is somewhat a reactive process, so we do not prescribe or dictate how grant applications should be. It\u2019s somewhat reactive and organic in the sense that it might just happen that during wave six, for whatever reason, a lot of people happen to prepare their grants application and submit their model at the same time, and then the ones that were deemed fundable just all added up right. Then, what Boris was saying about the spoiler alert for wave eight, we don't know why, but wave eight actually had quite a few more event sponsorship-type grant applications that came in of different sizes, and we made the decision to fund them because we see value in them. So that's why some funds, some waves, given that arbitrary like drawing of timing, can be big or small or can be anything really. But one one thing to note would be that we avoid funding things that are just purely an idea with no work done yet, like if someone comes in and say, \u201cI have this grand idea but I haven't done anything about it, I need money to do it,\u201d we try to avoid doing that normally. Our thinking, and I think we're in alignment, is that grants funding should be mostly for things that people already put some thought and effort into, already pursued, and have some minimal progress to show. So that also influences our decision-making process.\n\n  \nJerry Sun (48:24): Right, you guys want to see a minimum viable product, I guess.\n\n  \nBoris Stanic (48:30): It\u2019s not really that we demand, it's just the necessity because we are a small grant program in terms of people who are part of it, and we don't have enough manpower to get the whole project off the ground because that's the hardest part, getting it off the ground. We are here more to help you get from the current stage of your project to the next stage of your project, but getting the whole thing off the ground is currently too much for us. Maybe sometime in the future if we grow in numbers and manpower, we will be able to support such ideas, but right now it's more about getting the projects to the next level.\n\n  \nJerry Sun (49:24): Right, right. Some of the things that you said in your earlier answer, Boris, about funding events in some smaller places, I think that's a really great idea. You're really stretching the value of the funding in a lot of ways, and I assume some will be similar to Art Basel and we have it on the screen here as one of the things that you guys funded previously or funded last year but, uh I think that funding went to setting up a booth right to onboard people into crypto. Is that a similar goal that you guys are hoping to achieve with these funds for the smaller events?\n\n  \nBoris Stanic (50:10): For the smaller events, when we think about it, it's not as much about Uniswap as it is about onboarding people to the cryptocurrency space and blockchain space in general. So we want to support people getting into the community of blockchain in general, and then eventually they will stumble upon Uniswap almost for sure, which is great for us. So yeah, we want to support these communities to grow and eventually they will reach Uniswap as well. And yeah, a similar case with Art Basel, we thought that there will be a lot of people there that have interest in cryptocurrencies, but maybe didn't have anybody you know to onboard them to the space, so we thought it'd be a great idea for us as a grant program to support that.\n\n  \nJerry Sun (51:26): Right, gotcha. That makes a ton of sense. I'm really excited to kind of see the grants that get released in wave eight. You gave a little spoiler here, but curious to see what things got funded. If we move to the governance section, I know we got a couple minutes here at the very end, and I know there are some questions that we'll get to from the community, but if we go to the next page in this deck, the last page in this deck, I\u2019ve got a list of some major governance updates from this past quarter. It's a little bit small here, but one of the things I really want to talk about and get your personal opinions on is the fee switch. This fee switch is something that everyone talks about, it's very famous in the crypto community, and I think for this particular proposal, it got rejected because it sounds like people wanted to go and set up a research group to understand how to best set up the fee switch or how to best turn on the fee switch. In your personal opinions, when do you think the fee switch should be turned on, if ever, and how should it be done if that time does come?\n\n  \nBoris Stanic (52:55): Yj maybe you take this one, I know you have a lot of opinions about the research.\n\n  \nYj (53:02): Sorry I was just typing answers in the chat. I think the fact that no consensus has been forthcoming kind of just says it all. We have people asking about and proposing it and and talking about it, but it never really got enough traction as far as I can see, so in terms of the incentive, if you have fee switch then the community treasury will get the fee, so it gets fed back to the community treasury which is also controlled by $UNI token holders with delegated voting rights. So if overall, the dedicated voting power collectively feels that fee switching is a good thing, then I would imagine you go ahead and at least progress a bit further. My personal opinion right now is that nothing is happening yet, maybe there's no real need for it yet, but it can happen anytime, so we should continue conversations and have debates about this. If possible, we should get some data-backed opinions or commentary on it to see what to do next, so that's what I think.\n\n  \nJerry Sun (54:45): But do you think the fee switch will ever happen? Because, in theory, there is a potential future where you have this fee switch and it just never gets turned on, because the way the current system is, LPs get a lot of fees and it works for them and then Uniswap as a protocol provides a service, they don't necessarily earn protocol revenue that goes to the community. I don't know if you guys think it will ever happen or not?\n\n  \nFederico Landrini (55:19): It\u2019s a good question and I don't think there is an answer. It's very difficult to forecast what will happen. For me personally, the important part is the health of the protocol and the growth of the protocol, and then I think that when the community is ready and we know what we want to do, we can find a solution. The important thing is to have a LP protocol, and then once we decide to switch or another governance decision that improves the tokeneconomics of you of the $UNI token, it could work. So for me, the key thing at the moment is to really focus on the health of the protocol, as you showed your report.\n\n  \nJerry Sun (56:04): Right, right. I think that makes a lot of sense. We have a couple of questions from the community here, so I think we could spend the last couple of minutes answering those. The first question I notice is, \u201cplease tell us quarterly volume of centralized exchanges like Binance and Coinbase, so we can compare how they are doing with Uniswap.\u201d To my knowledge, I think Coinbase processed about $525B worth of trades in the quarter and I think the previous quarter was around like $330B or so. For them, it was an increase, but compared to Uniswap, if you look at the quarters, I think Uniswap processed about $180B. So the values you're looking at are $180B and $525B. Uniswap is processing about a third of the transaction volume of Coinbase, but Coinbase is seen as a traditional fiat on-ramp for a lot of people. Institutions are also heavily active on a lot of centralized exchanges, so it's not a direct apples-to-apples kind of comparison in that sense, but I think to say that Uniswap is processing a third of the transaction volume of a company like Coinbase is no small feat, in my personal opinion. Another question I\u2019ve got is, \u201cthe purpose of Uniswap grants is to encourage development of projects built on top of\u00a0 the Uniswap protocol or something else?\u201d\n\n  \nBoris Stanic (58:00): It\u2019s to grow the Uniswap protocol and its ecosystem, so we encourage development on top of Uniswap. We believe if we make it streamlined, easier, better documentation, more resources supporting more programming languages and make that whole process more enjoyable, that is how we encourage development on top of Uniswap. Finding strategic partnerships and things like that is out of scope for the grants program, so we are here so that once you decide to build on top of Uniswap, you have the best time of your life. But making you and giving you a reason to do so, that's more for that particular team or a person to decide on.\n\n  \nJerry Sun (59:02): Right, got it. This last question we have from the community is: these governance proposals seem fixated on extending Uniswap to other fledging protocols. This is worrisome. Who is focusing on making the core product better and easier to use? This comes from John. I can answer this one as well. We're talking about the uniswap grants program, and that's separate from Uniswap Labs. Uniswap Labs is doing a lot of the development of the protocol they've got the engineers who are working on the protocol. The grants program is a portion of the funding from the treasury and their mandate is to essentially, like Boris was saying, build the Uniswap ecosystem and spread awareness on the crypto economy as a whole, so completely separate. I'm sure the people at Uniswap are definitely working on improving the product, and I think we are at time here so we can just about wrap up. John's question is actually very related to my final question which is: you guys are a little bit closer to what's going on with Uniswap than many of us on the call, so I wanted to just quickly ask if you have any alpha or any insights into what Uniswap V4 might look like. I think we're all kind of curious.\n\n  \nYj (1:00:35): I don't have anything. I actually don't. I have no idea and that's why we were saying the other day, remember that the grants program is completely separate from Uniswap Labs, so I don't know, maybe Boris has some alpha.\n\n  \nBoris Stanic (1:00:53): To be honest, the first time I heard about V4 was yesterday when they were discussing some applications and somebody said, \u201cthis will help in researching the V4,\u201d and so that's as much as I know about the V4. Did somebody say there will be a V4?\n\n  \nJerry Sun (1:01:17): I assume there will be, that's kind of my assumption.\n\n  \nBoris Stanic (1:01:21): Okay, this is just my personal opinion of what Uniswap V4 might be. So Uniswap V4, in my opinion, will be a Uniswap that combines all the different deployments. You'll have a single interface, you'll select which token you want to swap to which token, and it will execute on some chain where you will get optimal fees, slippage, price and execution time. You won't even know where it executed, but the tokens that you wanted will end up in your wallet and that will actually be the V4. We, as a governance, deploying Uniswap V3 on all these different chains, scaling solutions side chains whatever, is the path to V4, but as I said, this is just my opinion of what V4 might be.\n\n  \nJerry Sun (1:02:29): All right. Fede, Yj, do you guys want to make any predictions?\n\n  \nFederico Landrini (1:02:33): No, no predictions. I like the vision of Boris, but it's just a wish at the moment. We really don't have any kind of insight on a roadmap or anything like that.\n\n  \nJerry Sun (1:02:47): Got it. Alrighty, well we are kind of past the hour here. I appreciate you guys all hopping on, this is a really enjoyable experience and I enjoyed getting to chat about the health of the protocol, what you guys are doing on the grants program, and some of these roadmap and governance updates that are currently ongoing. Thanks everyone for tuning in, the audience and to the three of you guys, and wish you guys a good rest of the day.", "references": [{"name": "Jerry Sun", "url": ""}], "published_at": "2022-04-18T00:01:00Z", "author": {"name": "Jerry Sun"}, "tags": ["Quarterly-Reports"], "url": "https://messari.io/article/state-of-uniswap-q1-analyst-call-transcript"}, {"id": "8c697fcf-4ec8-433c-a427-cdcfd6355a03", "title": "Weekly Recap Ending April 14", "content": "Notable Messari Intel Updates\n\nCircle Internet Financial, the issuer of USDC, announced that it has agreed to raise $400 million from BlackRock, Fidelity Management and Research, Marshall Wace LLP, and Fin Capital in a funding round expected to close in Q2 2022. In addition to the strategic investment, BlackRock has entered into a broader strategic partnership with Circle to explore capital market applications for USDC, among other use cases.\nThe Acala team has announced that they are working to integrate LDOT and LKSM, Acala and Karura's yield-bearing staking derivatives, as collateral assets on Anchor. The teams will also work together to establish deep liquidity pools for aUSD and UST on Acala to serve as a gateway into the Polkadot ecosystem for UST users.\nUniswap has announced the launch of Uniswap Labs Ventures. The announcement said that \u201cUniswap Labs Ventures will invest in teams at different stages and levels of the Web3 stack, from infrastructure to developer tools and consumer-facing applications.\u201d\nThe Yearn Finance Team, via Twitter, endorsed the adoption of the ERC-4626 token type, a new standard for tokenized Vaults and yield-bearing tokens. The team stated, \"In a word, ERC-4626 will be the gold standard for any sort of interest-bearing token\u2026 from Yearn Vaults to AAVE deposits and Balancer linear pools.\" Currently, contributors are working to implement the ERC - 4626 standard for Yearn V3 Vaults with no stated timeline for completion.  \n\nNotable Messari Governor Updates\n\nBitDAO has submitted a proposal that aims to approve a partnership between BitDAO and PleasrDAO in which BitDAO will invest $6.5 million (95% ETH/USDT and 5% in BIT). PleasrDAO is a collector DAO that buys and funds culturally significant digital art pieces. The partnership will diversify BitDAO's investment into art/NFTs. Voting is currently active.\nAfter the Balancer team discovered that the current gauge system does not perform as intended in the original veBAL tokenomics proposal, the Balancer DAO submitted a proposal that aims to determine whether the Balancer community prefers to deploy a new veBAL gauge system or use the current gauge system. Voting will start tomorrow.\nThe Idle DAO succeeded in passing a proposal that aims to initiate the process of enabling external contracts to integrate with the stkIDLE module. The current whitelisting process has resulted in multiple whitelisting proposals being halted due to failed voting sessions. The new approach would implement the SmartWalletWhitelist contract to manage all contracts interacting with the staking module.\nThe Balancer DAO succeeded in passing a proposal that aims to authorize Bancor 3 Beta Release to observe an operational deployment of the system in a limited capacity. The Beta release will run for 28 days concurrently with a $30 million BNT rewards program (13,043,478 BNT) and a $1 million bug bounty supported by the Bancor Foundation.\nThe DODO DAO failed to pass a proposal aimed to solve the issues of multichain voting rights and low voter turnout for the DODO governance. To solve the multichain voting rights, it seeked to approve creating a new governance framework for use in place of Snapshot. The new voting system would be similar to Snapshot, using an off-chain signature collection and a decentralized storage system to count votes. However, it would account for DODO held in multiple chains when assigning voting power to users, unlike the current strategy that only accounts for DODO on Ethereum.\n\nSector Returns\n\nThe crypto market has tumbled again, marking the second week in a row where all sectors covered return drawdowns. Four of the six sectors covered returned double digit-losses, with Web3 being the biggest loser. The Web3 sector has been among the hardest hit during the recent weeks \u2014 this week losing 12.57%. Gaming also had a rough week, trading places with Web3 as the sector with the biggest decline most recently. It returned -11.41% on the week.\n\nTop Assets\n\nDogecoin (DOGE) has continued to hold its ground. It was the only asset within the top 10 assets by market capitalization that made it above water last week, and this week, it declined the least. This week, the original dog coin only lost 1.4% in value. Contrast this to Terra (LUNA) which was the laggard of the group and ended the week with a 21.4% decline.\n\nDeFi Assets\n\nAll top DeFi assets by market capitalization ended the week in the red with the exception of one \u2014 Loopring (LRC). The zkRollup-based Layer-2 platform\u2019s asset saw its price gain 5.8% on the week, while the broader DeFi ecosystem suffered losses. Aside from the one outlier, more than half of the DeFi assets saw double-digit losses. Anchor (ANC), after being the top-performing DeFi asset for last week, gave all of its gains back and now finds itself more than 65% down from all-time-high. The Terra-based lending and borrowing platform saw its token end the week with a 13.5% loss. Impressively, although most DeFi assets are far away from all-time-high territory, DeFi TVL has remained on relatively healthy levels, currently sitting at $159.39 billion.\n\nSmart Contract Platforms\n\nAll top smart contract platform tokens ended the week in negative territory, with 7 of the top 10 assets by market capitalization seeing double-digit negative returns. NEAR protocol started the week on a high note, gaining 12% in value but then giving it all back and joining the rest of the sector performance wise. The Proof-of-Stake-based blockchain token managed to secure the number one spot for the week by a small margin, having the smallest decline (-5.3%). Terra (LUNA) was the laggard of the group, ending the week with a 21.9% decline.\n\nCurrencies\n\nOnly two currencies ended the week in green territory, with Monero (XMR) leading the pack and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) taking the second spot. XMR traded above positive territory for most of the week, which was enough to help the privacy-focused coin secure the first spot with a moderate 2.2% gain. Bitcoin Cash on the other hand slumped mid-week with the rest of the sector but was able to recover the 10% loss in order to secure its second place with a 0.7% gain. Zcash had the largest decline within the top currencies by market capitalization, ending the week with a -17.1% return.\n\nWeb3\n\nThe worst performing sector of the week saw six of its top ten assets end the week with losses in the double-digits. Interestingly the biggest losers were among the highest by market capitalization within the sector. The asset that declined the least within the category was Audius (AUDIO), returning -5.9% on the week. Filecoin (FIL) secured the endmost position of the group with a 15.8% decline.\n\nGaming\n\nGaming was the second worst performing sector of the week, with losses ranging from -4.5% to -15.5% and half of the top assets returning double-digit losses. Aavegotchi (GHST) is one of the less volatile assets within the gaming ecosystem and sustained the least drawdown for the week with a 4.5% decline. Yield Guild Games (YGG) held the rear position this week with a 15.5% loss.\n\n", "references": [{"name": "Guillermo Avil\u00e9s", "url": ""}], "published_at": "2022-04-15T14:08:00Z", "author": {"name": "Guillermo Avil\u00e9s"}, "tags": ["Macro"], "url": "https://messari.io/article/weekly-recap-ending-april-14"}, {"id": "9e3bab38-f604-4e39-ad30-a6f0d8c711b7", "title": "State of Compound Q1 2022", "content": "Download a PDF version of this report by clicking here.pdf).\n\nInteract with the real-time data that created this report on the Dune Analytics dashboard.\n\nWatch the full replay of the analyst call featuring Getty Hill of GFX Labs and the 2021 Compound Grants Committee or read the transcript.\n\nKey Insights\n\nOutstanding Loans and Deposits fell 42% and 32%, respectively.\nLiquidation metrics increased 290%, exceeding $134 million in Q1.\nCOMP incentives have dropped 50% in the quarter and are set to diminish to zero by Q2.\nQuarterly borrow and deposit rates averaged 3.8% and 1.5%, respectively\nDAI quarterly deposits declined over 90% in the Q1\n\nIntroduction to Compound\n\nLaunched in September 2018, Compound is a leading interest rate protocol built on Ethereum that enables users to permissionlessly borrow and lend assets from a pool of collateral. It sets interest rates for those assets algorithmically using an interest rate model based on the proportion of assets lent out, which it calls the utilization ratio. Compound launched its V2 protocol in May 2019, which introduced additional assets, individual risk models, and smart contract gateways for each asset, among other features. In April 2020, Compound replaced the administrator of the protocol with community governance, empowering COMP token holders to take control of the protocol. In June 2020, Compound began distributing COMP to users via a pioneering liquidity mining program reserving 42% of the total COMP supply to be distributed to users over the next four years.\n\nCompound KPIs across the board were largely down due to market volatility, decreasing overall loan appetite and applying supply pressure. Outstanding loans and deposits fell 42% and 32%, respectively, while liquidations skyrocketed 295% in Q1. Governance facilitated a few key changes to the protocol, including collateral factor adjustments, updating the price oracle, reducing COMP proposal thresholds, and reducing COMP rewards by 50%.\n\nCompound Markets \u2013 Macro Overview\n\nAs Q1 2022 wrapped up, many key performance indicators for Compound experienced substantial declines. The quarter ended with a 42% decline in outstanding loans, a 32% decline in outstanding deposits, a 53% decline in originations, which was already down 32% in the prior quarter, and an astounding 79% decline in deposits. Quarterly deposits hit an all-time-low in the trailing twelve months (TTM). Q1\u2019s only growth area was in liquidations with a monstrous 295% increase, totaling $134 million, largely driven by market volatility towards the end of January.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the slashing of KPIs across the board had a material impact on protocol financials. Net income, which was up 12% in the prior quarter, fell by 48%, totaling $4.9 million in the quarter.\n\nLast quarter was catalyzed by the total crypto market cap experiencing all-time-highs of $2.97 trillion. After an overheated end of 2021, the market cooled off and shaved over 40% in value, ending January with approximately $1.68 trillion in total market cap.\n\nOutstanding loans were down 42% in the quarter, dropping to levels seen back in Q1 2021, when the total crypto market cap also had a cooling period. Loans in stablecoins denominated in USDC and DAI continued to outpace loans denominated in other assets. DAI maintained its market share of overall loans outstanding on Compound as Q1 2022 ended.\n\nBorrower interest rates were relatively stable compared to the prior quarter. The average annualized interest rate was 3.85%, down from 5.02% in Q4. Rates decreased as users\u2019 demand for leverage decreased as the market cooled off in Q1. Additionally, the COMP distribution bug in Q4, resulted in assets leaving the protocol, which impacted supply and drove rates higher. Borrower interest rates maxed out at 4.48% as the market hit YTD lows.\n\nOutstanding deposits were down 32% in Q1 with the steepest decline transitioning into February. Similar to outstanding loan volumes, deposits approached TTM lows seen in Q2 2021. Deposit volumes rose in March with depositors continuing to prefer WETH.\n\nDepositor interest rates were down but stable over the quarter. This can be attributed to deposits consistently matching borrower demand. The average quarterly depositor interest rate was 1.51%, down from 2.04% in Q4. Annualized interest rates hit a low of 1.19% in Q1 and peaked at 1.87%. Interest rates saw their steepest decline at the end of January due to market volatility.\n\nCompound\u2019s aggregate utilization ratio remained relatively flat at the onset of 2022 but gradually weakened as the crypto market experienced turbulence rolling into February. Outstanding deposits declined at a slower rate of 32% relative to 42% for outstanding loans, which contributed to the utilization ratio revisiting its lows back in Q3 and Q4 2021.\n\nInterest income for the quarter deteriorated by 54% compared to Q4 2021. Coincidentally, interest and protocol income virtually experienced the same percentage changes in Q1. USDC dropped the furthest, falling 62%, followed by USDT and WBTC declining 50.8% and 50.7%, respectively. Quarterly interest income was impacted because market volatility decreased loan appetite.\n\nProtocol income was halved, dropping from $10 million in Q4 2021 to slightly under $5 million in Q1. DAI, which is responsible for over 60% of protocol income in Q1, was down 47% quarter-over-quarter.\n\nThe narrative continues across originations (new loans) for Q1. Total originations were down 53% in the quarter, led by DAI with a $2.9 billion drop (66%), over the quarter. USDC and USDT held strong but still had large declines of 48% and 47%, respectively. USDC continued to show dominance in origination volume from the prior quarter. WBTC was the only asset that grew in originations over the quarter, resulting in a 17% increase or $1.7 million.\n\nNew quarterly deposit volume took a nosedive in Q1, falling from $63 billion to $13 billion, or 79%. DAI quarterly deposits plunged by over 90%, from $44 billion to $4 billion in Q1. Compared to DAI, WBTC fell a modest 18% in deposit volume in the quarter. On-chain data suggests a user was using flash loans to arbitrage between AAVE and Compound in December 2021, driving quarterly deposits up 587%. Subsequently, another market-maker pulled DAI off the protocol in Q1, contributing to the spike in deposit volume quarter-over-quarter.\n\nDAI, WETH, and USDC are now in contention for overall quarterly deposits on Compound, with $4 million, $3.6 million, and $3.5 million in deposits, respectively. USDC was able to close the gap on WETH deposit volume in Q1, relative to the prior quarter.\n\nLiquidations on Compound peaked towards the end of January, growing 295% quarter-over-quarter. This activity was largely due to liquidations across the WETH and USDC markets resulting in increases of 270% and 665%, respectively. WETH liquidations grew from $14 million in Q4 to $106 million in Q1, largely due to ETH volatility experienced in late January. USDC markets experienced a $13 million increase in liquidations over the quarter while DAI liquidation volume was virtually non-existent in Q1 relative to the prior quarter of $3 million.\n\nCOMP token incentives fell drastically by 52% in Q1. These incentives are a key driver of depositor and borrower activity. Governance passed a proposal at the end of Q1 that would reduce COMP incentives by 50% with plans to eliminate incentive rewards. Given these plans, there should be a rapid decline in COMP token incentives in Q2.\n\nCompound\u2019s Five Largest Markets - Micro Overview\n\nCompound markets experienced various modifications in the quarter through governance. Gauntlet facilitated collateral factor adjustments across eight markets, GFX Labs introduced an updated price oracle, and a new algorithmic stablecoin market, FEI, was added to the protocol. Continuing last quarter\u2019s trend, borrowers continued to favor loans in stable assets over others.\n\nAlthough key performance indicators across the board were down in Q1, DAI continued to be the prevailing market on Compound, leading in metrics like loans outstanding, deposit volume, interest income, and protocol revenue. DAI loans outstanding decreased 47%, from $3.4 billion to $1.5 billion, while DAI\u2019s outstanding deposits decreased at a slightly higher rate of 49%, from $3.4 billion to $1.75 billion. Expectedly, quarterly originations were down 66%, from $4.4 billion to $1.5 billion. Liquidations in DAI were virtually non-existent in the quarter.\n\nAverage annualized interest rates were down from 4.5% in Q4, to 4.12% in Q1. Borrower interest rates hit a low of 3.58% and peaked at 5.10% in the quarter. The utilization ratio increased by 3.24% in Q1, resulting in borrower interest rate volatility. DAI continued to outpace loans outstanding, comprising over 42% of all loans outstanding ending the quarter.\n\nUSDC continues to be the second-largest loan market in Compound with $1.3 billion in outstanding loans, down 41%, or $2.2 billion from the prior quarter. Outstanding deposits declined at a slower rate of 37%, resulting in a utilization ratio decline of 6.2%. USDC borrower rates experienced far less volatility compared to the prior quarter with an average annualized interest rate of 3.56% in Q1. Interest rates peaked at 5.09% while bottoming at 2.62% in the quarter.\n\nOutstanding loans and deposits in USDT fell modestly compared to DAI and USDC. Loans denominated in USDT declined 14.5%, from $649 million in Q4 to $555 million in Q1. Subsequently, deposits fell 17% from $798 million in Q4 to $663 million. Utilization rates increased 2.9% over the quarter, with USDT borrower rates averaging 3.85%. After hitting a floor of 2.25%, interest rates began to increase, reaching 5.85% towards the end of the quarter.\n\nWBTC is the only asset within the top five in the protocol to experience a single-digit decline of 9.7% in outstanding deposits, falling from $1.8 billion in Q4 to $1.6 billion in Q1. In contrast, outstanding loans (USD) declined 62.7% from $134 million in Q4 to $50 million as the quarter ended.\n\nWETH continues to be Compound\u2019s largest market by deposits outstanding. Because KPI metrics were largely down in both outstanding loans and outstanding deposits during a very turbulent Q1, WETH liquidation metrics would logically benefit. WETH markets experienced a gut-wrenching 665% increase in liquidations, up from $14 million in Q4 to $106 million in Q1. This activity was mostly captured at the end of January and cooled off as the quarter wrapped up. Outstanding loans (USD) declined substantially by 61%, while outstanding deposits (USD) declined by 35%.\n\nWETH represents 36% of outstanding deposits and continues to outpace deposits denominated in other assets quarter-over-quarter.\n\nGovernance & Key Events:\n\nKey Events\n\nMakerDAO Deposit Module\n\nGFX Labs and the Compound community proposed to MakerDAO to prioritize launching a Compound DAI Direct Deposit Module (D3M), which is a Maker Protocol implementation that enables Maker to directly inject DAI into the Compound DAI borrowing market. MakerDAO voting passed a poll in January.\n\nCompound Comprehensive Protocol Audit\n\nThe Compound community recently voted to approve a long-term security partnership with OpenZeppelin, conducting audits over select Compound governance proposals along with advisory services and monitor solutions. Throughout the quarter, they\u2019ve identified several vulnerabilities which were laid out to the community with recommendations for future proposal upgrades.\n\nCOMP Rewards Dissolution\n\nA proposal was passed and executed at the end of March to reduce COMP rewards by 50% immediately and then winding down rewards to zero within a month.\n\nGovernance Decisions\n\nProposal 081 \u2013 Risk Parameter Updates for ETH (Exec. 01/18/22)\n\nProposal 081 made parameter adjustments to the ETH market, changing the collateral factor from 80% to 82.5%.\n\nProposal 082 \u2013 Dynamic Risk Parameters \u2013 Quarterly Update (Exec. 01/24/22)\n\nThis proposal reviews Gauntlet's partnership with Compound and updates its streaming grant for Q1 2022. Gauntlet proposes a quarterly fee of 8,168 COMP for the quarter.\n\nIn addition, as was requested by the Compound community, Gauntlet will replace its existing COMP stream with a Sablier stream. This governance proposal sets the Contributor Comp Speed to Gauntlet to zero and sets up a Sablier stream to Gauntlet instead.\n\nGauntlet has launched the Risk Dashboard, implemented five sets of parameter recommendations, published two monthly risk reviews, and safely unlocked additional borrow for Compound while maintaining protocol risk at safe levels.\n\nProposal 083 \u2013 Add Markets: FEI (Exec. 02/10/22)\n\nFEI USD was added as an algorithmic stablecoin on Compound with the following risk parameters: collateral factor 0%, reserve factor 25%, borrow limit \u2014 none, COMP rewards \u2014 none, and price source \u2014 Chainlink (Uniswap V2 FEI/ETH).\n\nProposal 085 \u2013 Risk Parameter Updates for UNI, LINK, MKR, AAVE, YFI, and SUSHI (Exec. 02/28/22)\n\nProposal 085 made parameter adjustments to six Compound assets as follows: cAAVE collateral factor from 60% to 65%, cLINK collateral factor from 70% to 75%, cMKR collateral factor from 55% to 60%, cSUSHI collateral factor from 55% to 60%, and cYFI collateral factor from 60% to 65%.\n\nProposal 087 \u2013 Oracle Update (Exec. 03/17/22)\n\nThis proposal by GFX Labs aimed to update the protocol's price oracle to the Uniswap Anchored View. Chainlink currently pays double the gas costs to maintain prices on the current oracle and the pending oracle. All existing markets retain the same configuration, and FRAX, LUSD, and RAI are introduced.\n\n*The introduction of FRAX, LUSD, and RAI to the oracle was on a best-efforts basis and exists for governance\u2019s consideration in future asset-specific governance votes. Their addition is not an endorsement or opposition to their addition to the protocol.\n\nProposal 089 \u2013 Lower Proposal Threshold to 25,000 COMP (Exec. 03/19/22)\n\nThis proposal aims to lower the Compound protocol\u2019s proposal threshold from 65,000 COMP to 25,000 COMP.\n\nThe proposal additionally sets the minimum settable proposal threshold in GovernorBravoDelegate to 1,000 (this allows for lowering the proposal threshold in the future). The new change will allow anyone with a minimum of 25,000 COMP to make formal governance proposals on-chain for votes. The proposal grants 5 COMP to Ratan to reimburse gas fees for deploying the new GovernorBravoDelegate contract.\n\nThis proposal follows Proposal 88 by GFX Labs which was canceled and aimed at lowering the proposal threshold to 10,000 COMP.\n\nBased on community feedback, there was an agreement to reduce the proposal threshold from 65,000 to 25,000 COMP. This new threshold enables an additional 17 EOAs to make proposals, empowering more community members to participate in governance and programmatically reducing the barrier to entry for delegates.\n\nProposal 090 \u2013 Risk Parameter Updates for ZRX, MKR, and SUSHI (Exec. 03/21/22)\n\nProposal 090 made parameter adjustments to three Compound assets as follows: cMKR collateral factor from 60% to 65%, cSUSHI collateral factor from 60% to 65%, and cZRX collateral factor from 60% to 65%.\n\nProposal 092 COMP Rewards Adjustments \u2013 Kickstart Rewards: Step One (Exec. 03/26/22)\n\nThis proposal aims to build on previous discussions in COMP Reward Adjustments by ending the current COMP rewards program and starting a new COMP rewards program with the primary purpose of kickstarting new markets. This proposal will immediately cut existing COMP rewards by 50% and after one month will cut COMP rewards to zero. The proposal will introduce a program to identify interest rate models across all markets. Once the interest rate model is optimized, the team will establish an effective rewards program to kickstart new markets.\n\nThe initial objective of the COMP rewards program was to reward protocol users with tokens. While this was an effective way to onboard and reward early adopters, the practice of COMP farming for profit is not sustainable.\n\nMost COMP rewards have been distributed to mercenary capital, which they immediately sell off. This causes a great disservice to the existing users and tokenholders, ultimately diluting their share of the protocol. These incentives need to be used strategically to grow the protocol to the benefit of Compound, users, and tokenholders.\n\nProposal 092 is the first step toward launching the new rewards program. Existing rewards are being cut by 50%.\n\nGovernance Discussions\n\nGFX Lab\u2019s proposal includes a laundry list of protocol improvements \u2014 here are a few key:\n\nDeploy Compound V2 to L2s and side chains reducing gas fees and increasing accessibility\nTransition off legacy cTokens across markets, improving protocol revenue and corresponding interest rate models and bringing upside for the protocol\nAllocate resources to research, test, and upgrade existing interest rate curves, liquidation mechanisms, and developer code base\n\nCertora\u2019s Verification proposal aims to significantly and continuously improve the security of the Compound platform by offering a formal verification and path coverage tooling service to contributors and dApp developers within Compound.\u00a0\n\nGrant Program Overview\n\nThe community learned from the wildly successful Compound Grant Program (CGP) 1.0, which funded over $1 million in over 30 grants. The second iteration, CGP 2.0, is currently being designed with the vision to build the best community-led organization possible. The protocol plans to staff a full-time team to develop clear communication processes that enable more transparency across the community. However, the CGP has remained paused in Q1, due to a lack of focused resources to develop plans to launch CGP 2.0.\n\nRoad Map\n\nMulti-chain Strategy\n\nIn an effort to adapt to the rapidly changing blockchain landscape and learn from the challenges experienced during the development of Gateway, the Compound community has chosen to first establish a presence on EVM-compatible chains as fragmented multi-chain markets with shared liquidity pools.\n\nCompound Treasury\n\nScaling Compound Treasury will continue to be a focus in 2022. The Treasury is a centrally managed product built on top of the protocol. It is designed for non-crypto-native businesses and financial institutions, operating as an institutional on-ramp to Compound markets.\n\nCompound III\n\nCompound III is an EVM compatible protocol that enables supplying of crypto assets as collateral in order to borrow the base asset. The initial deployment of Compound III is on Ethereum and the base asset is USDC. The supply and borrow interest rates are bound by separate curves that have a utilization \u201ckink\u201d affecting the rate calculation. Accounts can only earn interest by supplying the base asset.  \n\nThe evolution of Compound relies heavily on community contributions through governance. Even if many members agree on what protocol improvements should take place, efforts can be stalled due to the allocation of resources and compensation structures of contributors.\n\nClosing Thoughts\n\nCompound\u2019s overall activity was largely influenced by the volatility of the broader market in the quarter. Retreating from Q4 market all-time-highs, users\u2019 appetite for loans and deposits declined sharply in Q1. This sentiment appears to be the primary driver in the decline of both borrower and deposit interest rates as well as protocol income, consequently resulting in triple-digit percentage increases in liquidations from the prior quarter.\n\nWith COMP rewards being slashed by 50% at the end of Q1 and plans to be ultimately brought to zero in the following month (Proposal 092), Compound markets should start to stabilize, shaking out mercenary capital who are the primary beneficiaries of incentive rewards. These protocol participants immediately sell off rewards, which can negatively impact COMP price and tokenholders. As a response, Compound is aiming to optimize markets across the board and introduce effective incentives to kickstart new markets. These actions should result in a net positive for COMP tokenholders, fostering a healthier and more sustainable protocol.\n\nThe recent onboarding of OpenZeppelin\u2019s security partnership and Gauntlet\u2019s risk dashboards are great examples of collaboration through governance. For Compound to remain competitive with the likes of AAVE and MakerDAO, critical protocol improvements in the near term are paramount. As COMP incentives diminish in the coming month, community members will need to continue driving strategic initiatives through governance to attract new users, increase market efficiencies, and ultimately improve the protocol\u2019s dominant position in the market.\n\n  \n\nThis report was commissioned by Compound, a member of Protocol Services.

In The Sandbox, anyone can create 3D assets like buildings, in-game items, and non-player characters. These assets can then be used to build diverse experiences including games, music and fashion events, social activities, quests, art exhibits, and contests. The Sandbox offers creators a set of intuitive tools that require no background in coding or in designing experiences. These tools include a 3D editor for making and animating items, a game maker for making experiences, and a game client. The Sandbox is actively working on making these tools as user-friendly as possible in order to unleash the creativity of its community. For instance, the 3D editor combines different in-game tokens to create user-generated assets.\n\nThese user-generated assets are ERC-721 non-fungible tokens that can be monetized on open markets. The Sandbox ecosystem leverages a series of tokenized gaming features including: a digital in-game currency used for purchases, monetization, and asset creation (i.e., SAND); ownable digital land within The Sandbox virtual world (LAND); a combination of LANDs to create a larger plot (ESTATE); a bundle of assets and scripting logic to create interactive experiences (GAMES); 3D virtual images created by players (ASSETS); tokens burnt to give attributes to assets (GEMS); and tokens burnt to create ASSETS (CATALYSTS). Thanks to the tradeable nature of these user-generated assets within its virtual world, The Sandbox has robust in-game economics.\n\nIn addition to owning the assets that they build, creators will be able to make experiences available on LAND parcels in The Sandbox Metaverse. The long-term goal of The Sandbox is to enable creators to build immersive experiences. The possibility to monetize LAND and in-game experiences has attracted investors to acquire LAND. The top owners of LAND include large investors in The Sandbox, such as Binance, Everyrealm, and Galaxy Interactive, as well as NFT communities such as Whale, MetaKovan, and Cyber Kongz. In addition, The Sandbox is actively forming partnerships with businesses that are willing to develop experiences within its virtual world and become early adopters. These partnerships span a suite of business verticals including gaming, music, entertainment, fashion, and lifestyle, to name a few. Partnership examples are presented in \u201cThe Sandbox Ecosystem: Notable Events\u201d section below.\n\nMacro Overview\n\nThere is a finite amount of Sandbox LAND \u2014 166,464 parcels. New LAND parcels are subject to primary sales \u2014 they are sold to private entities (in partnerships) or released for sale through auctions. Notably, 65% of all the LAND parcels have already been distributed, up 2% from Q4 2021.\n\nAs the volatile Q1 2022 has come to a close, LAND secondary sales volume decreased by 54% compared to the previous quarter. To put this into perspective, the secondary sales volume in Q1 2022 is still up 865% relative to Q3 2021. This quarter's decrease is the result of the metaverse hype starting to settle down since Meta's rebrand announcement in October 2021. The market is merely finding its equilibrium, and demand for LAND remains healthy despite the buying frenzy of Q4 2021.\n\nAt the same time, relative to Q2 2021, primary LAND sales grew 23%. The subject of primary sales are LAND parcels that are newly issued and are usually either sold to partners or through auctions. Still, primary LAND sales volume ($16 million) accounted for only 12% of the marketplace LAND sales volume ($136 million) in Q1 2021.\n\nIn terms of usage, The Sandbox launched the Alpha Season 2 of its gameplay in March 2022. Notably, during this launch, The Sandbox reached 2 million registered users. Considering the launch lasted four weeks, tracking its active daily or monthly users isn\u2019t useful at this point. Instead, unique LAND buyers may be an alternative proxy for the interest in LAND utility.\n\nThe number of monthly active LAND buyers is back to the more sustainable levels seen before Meta\u2019s announcement in late October 2021. This poses the question of what drives the value of digital land in The Sandbox virtual world, given that only a limited number of its users are currently being able to host and monetize experiences.\n\nIn our previous quarterly report, an in-depth analysis uncovered that LAND ownership is fairly concentrated, with the top owners holding onto their parcels. A follow-up question is whether this holding behavior is specific only to top owners. This quarter\u2019s report analyzes the LAND holding time and discusses the potential implications on the value of land in virtual worlds.\n\nMicro Overview \u2014 Holding Behavior\n\nIn an effort to understand LAND holding time, one may consider various clusters of buy & hold behavior. In this sense, one can think, for instance, of long-term buying behavior as holding onto parcels for longer than one year, while buy & sell could be described as holding periods shorter than 30 days. The current breakdown of the LAND holding time reveals that 7% of purchasers hold LAND for longer than one year, while 11% of purchasers hold LAND for less than 30 days. At the same time, the vast majority (72%) of LAND buyers hold the asset for 1\u20133 months.\n\nIn other words, 83% of buyers choose to sell their LAND sooner than 3 months after the purchase. This hints towards profit taking as a driver for LAND owners to buy & sell their assets. Below we analyze the profit taking behavior by looking at buy & sell transactions that took place within 30 days. For each of these buy & sell transactions, the difference between the sale price and the corresponding buy price is summed up on a daily basis.\n\nNote that peak profit taking occurred on Nov. 24, 2021 \u2014 roughly one month after the Meta rebrand announcement. Since then, profit-taking behavior returned to sustainable levels. Additionally, since October 2020, only 19 days have seen negative aggregate profitability, with Dec. 31, 2021 having the largest negative balance. One may consider LAND buying potentially as a call option on The Sandbox gaining massive user traction.\n\nDespite the high interest in The Sandbox gameplay experiences signaled by the 2 million user registrations, the case for digital land is still in its early days in terms of the building of experiences. Intuitively, making immersive experiences available in The Sandbox may be a potential catalyst for sustainable value creation and capture. In this sense, users are eagerly awaiting immersive crypto-consumer gameplay experiences to be launched. Creators are well positioned to build immersive virtual experiences and make them available for users. In terms of capturing that value, owners may acquire specific LAND parcels with the hope that hosting virtual experiences on those parcels may, in turn, drive increased user activity. This could further create a flywheel for immersive experiences to be adopted on a large-scale, which, in turn, would boost the value of LAND parcels over the long-term.\n\nHowever, it is not presently possible for creators to make experiences available to others using LAND parcels. This may hinder real demand for the time being. While most LAND buyers may be initially inclined to hold, the absence of practical means to monetize LAND though hosting of experiences may tempt them to take profits. It is thus important for The Sandbox to continue building the backbone for immersive experiences and increased accessibility by users.\n\nFor The Sandbox to continue to grow and thrive, immersive experiences will need to be created and adopted on a large-scale. In this sense, an important metric to follow will be the number of active users of full gameplay releases that are not bound to specific time intervals.\n\nThe Sandbox Ecosystem: Notable Events\n\nPartnerships\n\nBrands show no signs of fatigue in joining The Sandbox ecosystem. Driven by the vast possibilities of building and monetizing experiences, a series of brands have announced partnerships with The Sandbox on several verticals, notably: gameplay (Ubisoft, SM Media, and Ethernity), music (Warner Music Group), entertainment (SHIBUYA109), diversity and inclusion (World of Women), sports and gaming engagement (HSBC), and fashion and lifestyle (Gucci, Arianee). Developing further partnerships will remain a focus area for The Sandbox for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe Sandbox Alpha Season 2\n\nIn March of 2021, The Sandbox launched Alpha Season 2 of its virtual world. The gameplay was bound to 4 weeks and enabled users to get Alpha Passes and earn SAND, the utility and governance token of The Sandbox. For the first time, The Sandbox reached the milestone of 2 million registered users. As part of Alpha Season 2, The Sandbox released 200 quests and 35+ experiences that were available to PC and Mac users that registered with a free account. The Sandbox looks to continue growing its user base with the upcoming Season 3 announcement.\n\nStaking on Polygon\n\nThe Sandbox introduced gasless mSAND staking in February. While SAND already maintains a liquidity pool on Uniswap, this program allows everyone on Polygon to get a share of the 500,000 mSAND weekly rewards. In addition, mSAND holders who provide liquidity to the program will be eligible to share a monthly allocation of 500,000 mSAND. Further staking rewards have been introduced during The Sandbox Alpha Season 2.\n\nRoadmap\n\nLooking ahead, The Sandbox has a few notable developments in the pipeline.\n\nProgressive Decentralization\n\nThrough progressive decentralization, The Sandbox aims to incentivize its community to come up with their own experiences. That is, The Sandbox is inspiring its community to build experiences for players and potentially unleash the next generation of massively successful games. While not yet deployed, The Sandbox DAO will be able to vote on Foundation grants as well as make decisions on game developments. The Sandbox DAO will be governed by both SAND token holders and LAND owners.\n\nNetwork Effects and Ecosystem Growth\n\nAs LAND will continue to be gradually opened and distributed in 2022, The Sandbox needs to grow its network effects. There will be a sustained effort in securing further partnerships and growing its ecosystem. The aim is to scale and attract various businesses \u2014 metaverse agencies, fashion houses, virtual real estate marketplaces. Ideally, these businesses would establish their own sales, leading to job creation and a wider variety of experiences available to players in The Sandbox.\n\nLaunch of Public In-Game Experiences\n\nThe Sandbox is still in alpha, which means that in-game experiences are presently unavailable. Once available, these in-game experiences are expected to further grow The Sandbox user base. Throughout the following quarters, The Sandbox plans to allow users to publish experiences directly on their LAND parcels so that other players can access them.\n\nClosing Summary\n\nThe Sandbox ecosystem continued its growth in Q1 2022, with notable partnerships and over 2 million registered users upon launching the Alpha Season 2 gameplay. This past quarter, The Sandbox also experienced the effects of the overall market pullback. As the metaverse hype started to settle down, marketplace sales of digital land came back to sustainable levels. The ambitions of The Sandbox are wide-ranging, with the potential to become one of the largest experience-based entertainment platforms.\n\nBased on its numbers and partnerships, The Sandbox remains at the forefront of virtual worlds. But, there remain some potential headwinds. The real test for the long-term viability of The Sandbox is building the technology backbone for more immersive experiences for its future players. With the success of the Alpha version launch, now is the time to test what works, track the adoption of features, and to be strategic about the roadmap and its execution. The ability to quickly pivot and adopt the most suitable strategy for the technical development of its virtual world will be key. For The Sandbox to become a true entertainment metaverse, immersive experiences will need to be created and adopted on a large-scale.\n\nThis report was commissioned by The Sandbox, a member of Protocol Services.

Whereas most competitors use consensus mechanisms in the Classical or Nakamoto families, Avalanche differentiates itself through its creation and implementation of a new consensus family known as \u201cAvalanche consensus.\u201d Following years of research, the Avalanche mainnet was launched in September 2020 and featured the release of a multichain framework utilizing three chains (the P, X, and C chains). Each chain plays a critical and unique role within the Avalanche ecosystem while providing the same capabilities of a single network.\n\nAs a follow-up to the State of Avalanche Q4 2021 report, this report will revisit developments and events from the prior quarter, analyze the network\u2019s most recent quarterly performance, and give insight into the coming months. A full appendix of data tables is available at the end of the report.\n\nThe First Quarter Narrative\n\nQ4 2021 was a period of high growth for the Avalanche network. With the Ethereum\u2013Avalanche bridge, major exchange listings, high-profile partnerships, and the Avalanche Rush liquidity program, the network was positioned to grow its user base and welcome new participants into its economy. As individuals and institutions piled in, Avalanche recorded all-time-highs in active addresses, daily transactions, total value locked (TVL), and market capitalization. As we moved into the new year, additional growth strategies and developments were on the horizon, but it was unknown whether the network would continue growing, experience a downturn, or show signs of stabilization.\n\nUltimately, Q1 2022 consisted of continued growth and the stabilization of network usage, financial performance, and network infrastructure. The outcomes were attributed to several key developments: the continued deployment of Avalanche Rush, the Blizzard ecosystem fund, Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) subnet development, and the introduction of the Multiverse subnet incentive program and Culture Catalyst fund. As existing enterprise partners such as Deloitte began to implement business solutions, new partnerships were formed over the quarter.\n\nNetwork Overview\n\nAcross the board, Avalanche experienced modest growth compared to the prior quarter, and its key metrics stabilized across the network. While the market cap was relatively flat (-5.4%), the network experienced continued uptrends in usage, revenue generation, and a move towards favorable fundamental valuation. Average daily transactions nearly doubled over the quarter (+82.8%), total revenue grew by 72.7%, and the price-to-sales (P/S) ratio continued to settle down, with the ratio of price relative to revenue moving from 160x to 91x.\n\nAs a result, daily active addresses did not reverse course, and instead, adoption continued as active addresses reached an all-time-high of 140,000 in January. For perspective, Avalanche had more active users in the first week of January than in all of October 2021. The network averaged around 70,000 daily active addresses during Q4 and reached a stable range with an average of 92,000 during Q1.\n\nSimilar to Q4, transaction activity on the network followed a similar pattern to daily active address growth. On aggregate, Avalanche's average daily transactions rose from 473,000 last quarter to 865,000 in Q1, which is ~ 74% of Ethereum\u2019s roughly 1.17 million. Daily transactions continued their upward trend with additional DeFi application launches and the rollout of GameFi subnets such as DeFi Kingdoms Crystalvale and Crabada. Ultimately, while on testnet, Crabada would become the top transaction driver on Avalanche during Q1. Beyond DeFi and GameFi, total 24 hour NFT volume surpassed $1 million for the first time, while the NFT market cap broke $110 million.\n\nThroughout 2021, the network experienced volatility in average daily transaction fees. With further releases of Apricot, transaction fees have since stabilized, averaging around $0.67 per transaction. Apricot is intended to facilitate \"verifiable pruning,\" a process where nodes can securely compact historical transactions. It features a fee mechanism that enables transaction costs to be low and predictable for users. While stable, transaction fees have been trending upward in tandem with daily transactions. With more anticipated releases of Apricot, we should expect to see average transaction fees continue to stabilize and trend downwards.\n\nFurther, the continued launch of subnets should put downward pressure on transaction fees. Subnets are a horizontal scaling strategy that aims to validate Avalanche blockchains running in parallel, enabling transaction order, and increased performance by splitting up network traffic allowing for optimization and more control over transaction fees.\n\nIntuitively, as daily active addresses and transactions grew, total revenue increased. Revenue grew by 72.7% over the quarter, and cumulative revenue became a more significant fraction of the network FDV. To put it into perspective, cumulative revenue as a percentage of FDV is 20x from a year ago, which signals that fundamentals like network revenue are moving more in line with market value.\n\nAvalanche\u2019s network revenue (transaction fees) is atypical for smart contract platforms. Rather than distributing transaction fees to validators, 100% of fees are burned from the network\u2019s circulating supply. This drives value to all token holders through increased scarcity rather than compounding the balances of validators and delegators. In other words, revenue growth should put upward pressure on the market value of AVAX. The question is just how statistically significant the spread between revenue and market value is. With that in mind, as fundamental value (as opposed to speculative value) becomes a more substantial part of market value, a strong correlation between revenue and market value should theoretically exist.\n\nMost notably, a spike in daily revenue on November 22, 2021, was accompanied by a spike in FDV. The same relationship exists between circulating market cap and price. Additionally, the spread between the two variables tightened during Q1, with occasional spikes in revenue once again accompanied by spikes in FDV. As the spread tightens, the network usage becomes more correlated to the market value. This correlation could indicate that the network is moving closer to fundamental value versus speculative value. If the relationship holds, then revenue will have a significant relationship with network value.\n\nSince June 2021, engaged stake and nominal staking yields have been stable, with an average annualized yield of ~10%. One of the last significant token unlocks occurred during March, but there was no indication of a change in engaged stake. Should those tokens engage or disengage in staking, there could be additional volatility in yield over the near term.\n\nEcosystem & Development Overview\n\nHeading into 2022, Avalanche DeFi was expected to be fueled by the ongoing Avalanche Rush program and the new $200 million Blizzard ecosystem fund. Over the course of Q1, Pangolin (PNG), an Avalanche native DEX, and Terra (LUNA) joined the Rush program and combined to bring TerraUSD (UST) to the Avalanche ecosystem. In total, $2 million in AVAX incentives were combined with additional LUNA and PNG rewards to incentivize usage.\n\nContinued network adoption was also evident in Avalanche development activity with unique contracts deployed and contract deployers having grown by 60.9% and 13.1%, respectively. Although development marched forward, TVL declined by 5.5%.\n\nThe TVL decline would have been more drastic if not for the continued growth and development in the DeFi sector. TVL is highly sensitive to overall market valuations. While TVL on Avalanche experienced a slight decline, top DeFi protocols Aave, Benqi, and Trader Joe experienced TVL declines of 4%, 18%, and 20%, respectively. Their collective TVL declined by 12% \u2014 more than twice the total Avalanche DeFi ecosystem\u2019s decline. Essentially, the continued growth and development of newer and smaller protocols in the Avalanche DeFi ecosystem offset the market forces negatively impacting top protocol TVL. Ultimately, like other metrics in the Avalanche ecosystem, TVL appears to have also stabilized at around $11 billion.\n\nAave, Trader Joe, and Benqi solidified their positions as the top three DeFi protocols after joining Rush in Q4. Collectively, these three protocols experienced a 12% decline in TVL, which is greater than the decline of the entire Avalanche DeFi ecosystem. The disconnect between the greater decrease in TVL across the top DeFi protocols and the lower decline of the entire DeFi ecosystem can be attributed to additional launches of DeFi services on the network, such as the launch of Platypus Finance (PTP).\n\nPlatypus Finance is a stableswap protocol that was the fastest growing DeFi application over the quarter, having grown from just $10 million to over $750 million in TVL, representing a ~7,500% increase. Platypus also became one of the top 10 applications generating network transactions on Avalanche.\n\nAdditional launches and Rush deployments, such as Pangolin and Terra, helped prop up Avalanche\u2019s TVL despite overall market declines. The other notable trend across Q1 was the steady long tail of DeFi protocols on Avalanche. Entering Q1, 60 protocols had amassed $1 million TVL, up from just 29 from the prior quarter. Exiting Q1, 60 protocols maintained the $1 million TVL mark. Despite the flat to down quarter, the number of applications with recorded TVL grew from 100 to 150.\n\nQ1 marked the beginning of Avalanche\u2019s highly anticipated GameFi subnet launches. Crabada quickly passed 5,000 users, measured by the number of unique wallet addresses interacting with the application's smart contracts. Daily transactions grew from 60,000 to over 400,000 over Q1, measured by transactions made to Crabada\u2019s smart contracts. Daily volume generally ranged between $130,000 and $1.5 million as measured by the total amount of incoming value to the application's smart contracts. Finally, the TVL in the application's smart contracts neared $50 million by the end of the quarter. Ultimately, the emergence of new DeFi and GameFi applications was fueled by continued growth in developer metrics.\n\nQ1 developer activity in the Avalanche ecosystem aligns closely with the network's overall TVL growth and recent entry into GameFi. The number of unique contracts deployed grew by 60.9% quarter over quarter and reached an all-time-high in March, just as Crabada and DeFi Kingdoms launched their subnets. The number of unique contract deployers slowed on a month-to-month basis but still managed to grow by 13.1% quarter over quarter. With the deployment of the Multiverse and Culture Catalyst funds, March's surge in contract deployments should continue through Q2 2022.\n\nThe growth of events in the Ava Lab\u2019s Github repository grew significantly (76.4%) throughout Q1. Given this was the greatest increase to date, the number of events indicates that the network\u2019s core team is accelerating the infrastructure buildout.\n\nStaking and Decentralization Overview\n\nThe security of PoS networks like Avalanche requires users to lock up the network\u2019s native tokens and participate in validation duties. A distributed network of validators and active participants can help ensure the network functions as intended.\n\nAfter a downwards trend at the beginning of 2021, engaged stake settled at around 60%, which has been maintained through Q1 2022.\n\nStaking amounts during Q1 were relatively uneventful, with average stake changes in the single digits quarter over quarter. Such predictability and lack of volatility are generally good for network health. Validator stake was consistently about 5.85 times greater than the amount of delegated stake. The amounts of unresponsive validator stake were higher than average on a few days, but the total amount of offline stake never came close to levels that could compromise the network.\n\nWhile the average staking amount was relatively flat, there was a material increase in the average number of validators and delegators. The average validator count grew from 1,138 to 1,259, representing a 10.6% increase in network security participants. The number of average validators joining the network stayed at about 11% growth each quarter. This stability is indicative of a growing, decentralized network.\n\nEach new Avalanche subnet will be required to validate on the Avalanche P-chain. As more subnets launch, the average number of validators should increase in tandem. The average number of delegators also grew from 16,459 to 17,179, representing a 4.4% increase. The number of delegators consistently outnumbered the number of validators, consistent with other PoS networks that support native delegation. The average number of offline validators continued to decline, decreasing by 14.9% over the quarter. Ultimately, low volatility in the network\u2019s staked AVAX combined with an increase in validators and delegators is a sign of healthy decentralization.\n\nThe Nakamoto coefficient is a metric first introduced by Balaji Srinivasan to quantify the decentralization of blockchain networks. The coefficient represents the minimum number of actors who can collude to disrupt the network. For Avalanche, the Nakamoto coefficient equals the number of validators that control one-third of the network\u2019s stake. Avalanche\u2019s Nakamoto coefficient hovered in the low 30s to begin 2021 but fell to 25 in June. Since this decline, the coefficient has remained stable in the upper 20s, putting Avalanche above the industry average for other Layer-1 networks.\n\nCompetitive Analysis\n\nCurrently, the Layer-1 space is a competitive race between new and legacy protocols to achieve the maximum possible network speed at the lowest possible cost and with the greatest degree of security. Each competitor has focused on maximizing these activities while making a range of trade-offs regarding centralization. The ideal blockchain would be fast, secure, widely used, and adequately decentralized.\n\nThe core technical advancements, developer activity, and ecosystem growth strategies may separate one L1 from another. Here, we evaluate Avalanche\u2019s progress versus the top five EVM compatible chains (including Avalanche) by TVL. The methodology used to derive this peer group is simply by grouping the EVM chains with the largest TVL, seeing as today, DeFi is the sector driving the majority of each network\u2019s economic activity.\n\nAvalanche experienced the lowest decline in value in terms of market cap and closed in on BNB Chain market share while further separating itself from Fantom and Polygon.\n\nSimilarly, Avalanche\u2019s daily revenue trended upward. At the same time, all other EVM chains experienced a decline, allowing for Avalanche to close in on BNB Chain and further separate from Fantom and Polygon.\n\nAvalanche\u2019s P/S ratio declined over the quarter, while other chains aside from Fantom experienced an increase in this valuation metric. From a relative valuation perspective, Avalanche is now more in line with Ethereum with a P/S of 91x versus Ethereum\u2019s 81.5x.\n\nBoth Avalanche and Fantom reached similar levels in Q1 daily transactions. Ethereum has held steady at ~1.17 million transactions per day, with Avalanche now reaching ~74% of Ethereum\u2019s average daily transactions. With the incentive programs taking hold and subnet launches on the way, Avalanche has an interesting opportunity to surpass Ethereum over the next quarter.\n\nQ1 was a flat to down quarter for the crypto market, with aggregate TVL decreasing from $240 billion to $230 billion. Avalanche\u2019s TVL declined at the second slowest rate among the top EVM chains, only trailing behind Fantom. A significant portion of Avalanche\u2019s stability came at the expense of Ethereum, BNB Chain, and Polygon, each declining by double-digit percentages. As the above chart illustrates, Avalanche closed in on BNB Chain in this area. The Avalanche Mcap/TVL ratio also ended among the lowest. As a measure of network value relative to TVL, it signifies a closer relationship between the network value and the DeFi economic activity occurring on the network.\n\nKey Events, Catalysts, and Strategies for Ecosystem Growth\n\nQ1 2022 proved to be another significant quarter for the Avalanche ecosystem. Indeed, growth strategies and development activity contributed to Avalanche's ecosystem growth, as evidenced by the data presented in the previous sections of this report. The results can be attributed to several key developments:\n\nThe continued deployment of Avalanche Rush\nDeployment of the Blizzard ecosystem fund\nCustom EVM subnet development\nIntroduction of the Multiverse program and Culture Catalyst fund\n\nJanuary 2022\n\nAvalanche's Q1 began with the launch of the Subnet-Ethereum Virtual Machine, a custom VM that enables users to easily and rapidly create their own, configurable EVM-compatible blockchain. By the end of the first week of January, Pangolin announced plans to launch its own subnet. During the first week of January, not only was the Avalanche ecosystem gearing up for subnets, it was introducing additional enterprise partners. Ava Labs entered into a strategic partnership with Turkey's electronic vehicle manufacturer Togg to design and build smart contract-based services to improve autonomous mobility.\n\nBy the middle of January, Bitwise, a prominent crypto index fund manager, reconstituted the Bitwise 10 Large Cap Crypto Index and added AVAX. Days later, Terra passed a proposal to bring UST to Avalanche with Liquidity Mining Proposal #3. Further ecosystem collaboration came about when Celsius Network announced support for Avalanche, allowing users to borrow against AVAX from a centralized provider. Further, 1inch, a widely used DeFi aggregator, was deployed on Avalanche.\n\nJanuary concluded with the first subnet launches on Avalanche with Spaces, a website allowing users to store and share links, images, and files all on-chain, and WAGMI, a subnet demo that is a high-throughput testbed for EVM optimizations. Finally, to round out the month, Anchor Protocol, the largest DeFi protocol on Terra, proposed and passed a UST borrowing strategy whereby sAVAX entered the platform as its newest collateral asset.\n\nFebruary 2022\n\nAs reported in Q4 2021, one of renowned street artist Banksy's most iconic pieces, Love is in the Air, became a fractionalized NFT on Avalanche. The NFT was made possible by Particle, which partnered with Avalanche to bring fine art on-chain in November. By February, the Banksy NFT generated interest and purchases by celebrities such as Paris Hilton. The Particle Banksy collection would later sell out in March.\n\nAlso reported in Q4, a multi-year agreement with Andretti Formula E Autosports marked the first title sponsorship from a blockchain company with a Formula E team with a natural alignment between organizations committed to sustainability. By mid-February, the Avalanche Andretti team made its debut at the Mexico City E-Prix, the Formula E World Championship.\n\nMarch 2022\n\nMarch was a pivotal month of Q1. The uptick witnessed in daily transactions was largely due to the launch of the Crabada and DeFi Kingdoms subnets with Crabada running testnet and DeFi Kingdoms live on mainnet. To support the growth and development of subnets, the Avalanche Foundation announced the launch of Avalanche Multiverse, a $290 million (~4 million AVAX) incentive program. The first subnet to receive incentives through the Multiverse program was DeFi Kingdoms. Subsequently, Wildlife Studios joined the Multiverse program and will be expanding its flagship game, Castle Crush, onto its own subnet, intending to integrate NFTs and tokens into the game.\n\nAt the end of March, the sold-out Avalanche Summit took place in Barcelona, Spain, with sponsors including Circle, Terra, and Bridge Tower Capital, to name a few. During this time, the Avalanche Foundation and Web3 social media platform Op3n announced a $100 million creator fund called Culture Catalyst. The fund intends to help creative projects launch on Avalanche and Op3n. The program's first recipient will be musician Grimes, who plans to create an \"intergalactic childrens' metaverse book.\"\n\nEcosystem Challenges\n\nQ1 did not present any drastic challenges like those that came with the growing pains of Q4. As reported last quarter, the Avalanche C-chain recorded new highs for daily transactions which caused the network to temporarily experience higher than usual transaction fees. This quarter, network optimizations known as Apricot quickly became apparent as average daily transaction fees declined and stabilized. With that in mind, transaction fees were trending upward towards the end of Q1 as daily transactions increased.\n\nThe anticipated solutions to scaling and lowering costs include governance, pruning, and subnet development, which will involve removing a gas limit mechanism, among other optimizations. The launch of subnets is in motion, and the horizontal scaling approach with subnets takes place will influence how transaction fees trend going forward.\n\nThe Road Ahead\n\nCurrently, Avalanche does not maintain an updated public-facing roadmap, so the protocol developments are not prescribed. However, it is expected that Avalanche Rush will continue to drive DeFi growth, Blizzard will support overall ecosystem expansion, Multiverse will drive subnet development, and Culture Catalyst will bring creative talent to the ecosystem.\n\nIt is also anticipated that core platform upgrades will continue. Significant upgrades (Apricot) are being implemented in six phases, following a successful series of Phase 5 in Q1. All phases of Apricot broadly represent one of the solutions (pruning) to the optimizing transaction fees.\n\nAs discussed during the Q4 Analyst Call, user experience improvement is of high priority. As part of this effort, Ava Labs announced details about Core, a free, non-custodial wallet explicitly created for applications on Avalanche with native support for subnets. The first iteration of Core is a browser extension, with the second being the Core mobile wallet expected to be released in early Q2. Ava Labs also announced that the Avalanche Bridge will enable support for Bitcoin, allowing BTC holders to transfer their BTC onto Avalanche securely. Bitcoin support is also scheduled to go live on mainnet in Q2. Ultimately, Ava Lab\u2019s goal is to make the user experience as seamless as possible, and the Core wallets and bridge developments are the first steps.\n\nAvalanche on-chain governance is also still in development. AVAX will, at some point, be used to provide on-chain governance for critical network parameters where participants can vote on changes to the network and settle network upgrade decisions democratically. Some of these parameters will include factors such as the minimum staking amount, minting rate, and transaction fees.\n\nWhile all Avalanche incentive programs may continue to catalyze ecosystem growth and garner more project launches and partnerships, significant technological advancements are critical for the teams developing the Avalanche infrastructure. The continued development of subnets and the launch of Core will play a key role. For subnets to flourish, Core will need to successfully support extended functionality for subnets, such as native bridging.\n\nClosing Summary\n\nNetwork usage, financial performance, development activity, and network infrastructure continued to grow and stabilize during Q1 2022. The growth was fueled by Avalanche Rush, the Blizzard ecosystem fund, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) subnet development, the Multiverse subnet incentive program, and the Culture Catalyst fund. Additionally, partnerships formed in Q4 with enterprises like Deloitte began implementing business solutions on Avalanche while more partnerships were formed. Altogether, Avalanche showed signs of capturing market share versus top EVM-compatible chains across several key metrics over the quarter.\n\nAcross the board, Avalanche experienced growth, and its key metrics stabilized across the network. While the market cap was relatively flat, the network experienced continued uptrends in usage, revenue generation, and a move towards favorable fundamental valuation. Further, continued network adoption was also evident in Avalanche development activity, with unique contracts deployed and contract deployers growing significantly.\n\nAvalanche incentive programs may continue to provide a catalyst for ecosystem growth. These programs may attract more project launches and partnerships, however, significant technological advancements are at the forefront of the teams developing Avalanche infrastructure. Significant developments to monitor going forward will be the continued development of subnets and the launch of Core. For subnets to flourish, Core will need to successfully implement its objectives to support extended functionality for subnets, such as native bridging. Ultimately, as with all Layer-1 networks, tracking the growth of the Avalanche network and its progress towards optimization and user experience will be top of mind looking ahead into the next quarter.\n\nThis report was commissioned by Ava Labs, a member of Protocol Services.

The protocol is recognized as a pioneer among decentralized exchanges (DEXs), first for its popularization of the X*Y=K constant product pricing curve of pooled liquidity in V2 \u2013 and subsequently for its concentrated liquidity and staggered trading fee features in V3. The constant product pricing curve has since been implemented across many other DEXs in the industry. The concentrated liquidity model and fee tiers continue to remain relatively unique across DEX applications.\n\nTo quickly recap, AMMs pair tokens into pools balanced by the aforementioned algorithm. Liquidity providers (LPs) can deposit funds into those liquidity pools where traders make trades by swapping tokens in and out \u2014 in effect, making trades with the pool. In exchange for providing liquidity, LPs earn transaction fees paid by the traders.\n\nImportant updates to the protocol in the past quarter include the rapid growth of trading activity on Polygon\u2019s Proof-of-Stake (PoS) chain (hereinafter: Polygon). Though Polygon was the last of Uniswap\u2019s scaling solutions to launch in 2021, Uniswap V3 transaction volume quickly surpassed other notable DEXs on Polygon, such as SushiSwap, QuickSwap, Balancer, on fractions of the total value locked (TVL) for other DEXs. Q1 2022 saw some important governance proposals as well: launches of V3 on Gnosis Chain and Celo have passed temperature checks and will be up for an on-chain vote shortly. One should also reasonably expect additional expansion proposals later this year.\n\nAfter a volatile Q4 trading quarter, 2022 represents an opportunity for normalization. Benchmarking quarter-over-quarter metrics will shed light on how Uniswap and its LPs respond to concerns of a bear market. A full appendix of quarterly data is available at the end of the report.\n\nMacro Overview\n\nOn the whole, Uniswap trading volume in Q1 2022 was 53.5% lower than the previous quarter. This corresponds with the global crypto market, which hit its peak market capitalization in Q4 2021 at $3 trillion and has since come back down to $2 billion. When token prices go up, trading volume generally increases as retail inventors become more interested; when token prices decrease, retail investors lose interest in crypto. And unlike Q4 2021, which saw both the resurgence of NFTs and all-time highs for BTC and ETH, trading activity in Q1 2022 has been more muted.\n\nOverall market liquidity dipped in Q1 2022, but to a lesser degree than volume. V2 was the only network to see a liquidity decline over the quarter, falling by 25.7%, while all the others saw nominal increases at a small scale. Since V2 includes more long-tail token pairs, a decline in V2 liquidity does coincide with lower retail trading volume. Meanwhile, market liquidity really shined in Uniswap\u2019s so-called scaling solutions, particularly Polygon. Polygon jumped almost 81.7% compared to the end of Q4 when it had just launched. The implications of Polygon\u2019s big win will be revisited throughout the report. Arbitrum and Optimism each saw growth too at 72.9% and 34.7%, respectively.\n\nPolygon\u2019s liquidity growth is particularly impressive given the lack of liquidity mining incentives for users in Q1. For context, when the initial governance proposal was made, up to $15 million was set aside by the Polygon team for liquidity mining purposes and another $5 million was prepared to support the ecosystem. As of the first week of April, these incentives have now been implemented. Only time will tell how much of a boost it'll give to Polygon's existing success.\n\nDaily LP fees fell 36.2% in Q1 2022 after jumping 54.0% in Q4 2021, resulting in final quarter-end numbers similar to the end of Q3 2021. Q4\u2019s numbers were such outliers due to the mainstream popularity of NFTs and all-time highs for both BTC and ETH. On the non-Ethereum front, Arbitrum gives Polygon a serious run for its money while Optimism lags behind. This data implies Polygon sees more trading of blue-chip token pairs (and thus, lower fees) while popular Arbitrum pairs trade in the higher fee tiers.\n\nTotal trading markets also continued to climb from the previous quarter, across all products from V2 on Ethereum to each of Uniswap\u2019s non-Ethereum networks. V2 continues to make up the vast majority of total available markets. V3 on Ethereum and Polygon comprise 11% of active markets while Optimism and Arbitrum remain negligible. As with market liquidity, Polygon grew the quickest in Q1, jumping almost 300% from the previous quarter. Given all the data, it\u2019s clear Uniswap has found a home on Polygon.\n\nMicro Overview\n\nThe markets on V3, while fewer in count, continue to trade more blue-chip token pairs. Trading activity on V3 also continues to rise on a quarter-over-quarter basis.\n\nTop V2 Markets\n\nThe top four most actively traded V2 markets for Q1 2022 were the following pools:\n\nUSDC/WETH\nUSDT/WETH\nSAITAMA/WETH\nFXS/FRAX\n\nTogether, the four pools represent less than 0.001% of the count of tradeable V2 markets but comprise 19.4% of total trading volume. Activity \u2013 and trends \u2013 from these four markets can be seen as leading indicators for the direction of the overall V2 ecosystem. However, given the trading pattern similarities USDT/WETH shares with USDC/WETH, further analysis of the pool was replaced in favor of the FXS/FRAX market for the purposes of this report.\n\nUSDC/WETH\n\nData from USDC/WETH shows trading volume continuing to decline after the launch of V3. V2 volume in the most recent quarter only accounted for 3.2% of total volume, only a tenth of V2 volume in Q2 2021. A total of $2.7 billion was traded in the V2 pool in Q1 2022, a 24.5% decline from the previous quarter. The capital efficiency of V3 makes it likely USDC/WETH trading activity on V2 will continue to decline and give way to further volume increases in its V3 counterpart.\n\nThe chart above represents our methodology of tracking LP profits/losses. Three scenarios were evaluated to compare the profitability of providing liquidity to this pool: a user providing liquidity for 30-, 90-, and 180-day windows. These windows were rolled through the entire last year to compare the profitability of these actions across time. For each window period, the corresponding impermanent loss caused by price change in the first and last day of the window was deducted from the equivalent yield generated from trading fees. The result is a moving net profit metric displayed above.\n\nThe USDC/WETH pair is a prime market to take a liquidity stake in, given the high volume of trades facilitated by the pool. Because most price fluctuations would be hedged by trading fees earned by LPs, one could expect decent returns when trading volume is high.\n\nOf the 365 days since Q2 of last year, only 52 of the rolling 180-day returns would have yielded losses for LPs who would\u2019ve chosen to retract their liquidity on any of those days. Even fewer days would have led to a loss for shorter-term LPs: for rolling 30-day LPs, the total impermanent loss would have exceeded fees for only 45 days of the year and only 12 days for those supplying rolling 90-day LPs.\n\nIn Q1 2022 alone, performance gets even better. All rolling 90- and 180-day LP positions over the entire 90 days in Q1 would have yielded a positive profit. For the rolling 30-day LP, every position would have been profitable, except for January 22-27th and March 5th.\n\nFXS/FRAX\n\nBoth tokens in the final V2 pool, FXS and FRAX, are tokens used by the Frax Protocol, an algorithmic stablecoin protocol built on a hybrid seigniorage model. FRAX is the actual stablecoin pegged to the US Dollar; FXS is the governance and value capture token used as partial collateral for FRAX. As a hybrid model, FRAX is collateralized by both the FXS token and a fraction of another stablecoin.\n\nThe extent to which the percentage of underlying collateral made up by FRAX and USDC or another stablecoin is determined by the collateral ratio, which changes with demand for FRAX. If FRAX supply is expanding, less stablecoin is needed; if FRAX is retracting, a higher collateral ratio of stablecoin is needed.\n\nWhat\u2019s important to know is that Frax has an FXS buyback program (Frax1559) for excess collateral. This occurs when yields are earned by the protocol\u2019s stablecoin collateral, causing total collateral to increase above the required collateral ratio. Frax uses the extra earned capital to mint new FRAX tokens and buy back outstanding FXS tokens.\n\nThus, the trading volume of the Uniswap FXS/FRAX pool is driven by the Frax1559 buyback program and should be relatively stable as long as FRAX remains successfully pegged to the US Dollar. Its emergence as a top-three traded pair this quarter reflects this stability while other volatile pools saw their trading volume sink. In total, trading activity in Q1 rose 6.9% for the most recent quarter after increasing 243.1% in Q4 2021.\n\nAnother factor adding to increased trading was chatter of a pending airdrop. The airdrop is for the upcoming FPI token. A snapshot was taken on February 20th of FXS of those who staked FXS tokens or were LPs of the FXS/FRAX pool. Those who heard about airdrop eligibility might have contributed to market activity by trading for FXS tokens or contributing to the liquidity pool.\n\nUnfortunately for LPs, the FXS/FRAX pool suffers mixed results. Trading fees were not strong prior to the implementation of FXS1559 while the token\u2019s price fluctuated wildly. The combination resulted in heavy losses across all three rolling time frames. Once the buyback program was initiated, trading volume picked up substantially. Though FXS price volatility didn\u2019t go away, the additional trading fees earned by LPs began to counteract impermanent loss, turning total LP fees positive.\n\nSAITAMA/WETH\n\nLast quarter, we described the rise of SAITAMA/WETH as a beneficiary of the November 2021 trading surge. After all, SAITAMA, as we noted, is the token for another of the doge-like projects that were so popular among retail investors, but its continued success has subverted expectations.\n\nNot only was SAITAMA/WETH a top-performing market in Q4 2021, it continued to be so for Q1 2022. That said, the asset pair did see overall trading volume fall 67.6% from the previous quarter. The trading volume growth of the previous quarters could not be sustained after a 2,500%+ increase in Q3 and a 700%+ increase in Q4. This highlights the broader trend of retail trading in the crypto markets: H2 2021, and Q4 2021 in particular, were very strong for memecoins and the general market, while Q1 2022 experienced a pullback.\n\nMarket liquidity for SAITAMA/WETH fell almost 40% from the previous quarter. Yet this decline still is less than the decline in trading volume. This all occurred while the price of SAITAMA fell by more than 75% over the quarter. LPs that kept their capital in the pool could have done so for many reasons, including the possibility of high fees or forgetting to close their market-making position.\n\nLPs who contributed liquidity to the SAITAMA/WETH pool saw a mix of positive and negative yields throughout the rolling 30-, 90-, and 180-day time frames. In line with expectations, most of the positive returns came in or after Q4 2021 when the trading volume began to pick up. Roughly 66%, or 62 out of 90 days in the quarter, led to positive returns for LPs over the 30-day time frame. The number of positive days increased to 82% for anyone supplying liquidity over a 90-day period but decreased to 32% for 180-day LPs, respectively.\n\nTop V3 Markets\n\nUnsurprisingly, the most active V3 markets are the USDC/WETH, USDC/USDT, and WBTC/WETH markets, which contributed 61.0% of V3 volume. Each market sheds a unique light on a different part of the crypto ecosystem: 1) ETH activity, the cornerstone of smart contract networks; 2) stablecoin markets, and 3) the relationship between the two largest crypto assets.\n\nUSDC/WETH\n\nThe USDC/WETH market is the predominant blue-chip stablecoin/ETH pair and the best indicator for ETH trading activity. It\u2019s worth noting that the USDT/WETH pair is also very active on Uniswap. In fact, it is the second most actively traded market. Demand for these three tokens is particularly high on Uniswap as most trades are denominated in those assets, which makes those markets the central routing point for market activity.\n\nTotal USDC/WETH V3 transaction volume for Q1 2022 amounted to $81.5 billion, an increase of 6.3% from the previous quarter. The majority of the increase came from the 0.05% fee tier, which jumped from $65.8 billion to $73.2 billion. The increase was partially negated by the decline in trading in the higher 0.30% tier. This trend highlights how competitive exchanges are. As noted in the Q4 2021 iteration of this report, capital competes with capital for fees and ultimately drives trades towards lower fee tiers.\n\nDividing the total fees by each dollar of liquidity highlights the yields an LP can expect to earn. A quick, high-level comparison of return on assets between the USDC/WETH V2 and V3 pools shows how much more capital efficient V3 is. V2 returns $0.04 for each dollar deposited, or 4.0%; the same calculation for V3 returns $0.12 for every dollar, or 12%. Note this doesn\u2019t account for each V3 LP\u2019s concentrated liquidity, but holistically summarizes V3\u2019s ability to generate a 3x higher return on its liquidity.\n\nAlthough Polygon found plenty of success in Q1, Arbitrum has a significant amount of liquidity available for USDC/WETH V3. Arbitrum has $16.2 million, i.e., 28.3% more liquidity than Polygon at $12.6 million. Because Arbitrum has been around longer, Polygon\u2019s liquidity has recently grown at a faster daily rate \u2014 and it will be supercharged even more with Polygon\u2019s liquidity mining program going live next quarter.\n\nUSDC/USDT\n\nUniswap was not competitive in the stablecoin DEX market until the implementation of its 0.01% trading fee tier. Once that became active, Uniswap could draw the attention of traders looking to pay the cheapest fees on highly correlated stablecoin pairs. The visual above clearly shows when that occurred.\n\nStablecoin trades in the USDC/USDT market jumped 60% overall against Q4 2021. This followed a 114.1% increase compared to Q3, more than tripling in nine months. Unsurprisingly, 87.3% of trading volume, or about $8.5 billion, came from the lower 0.01% fee tier. Liquidity, meanwhile, only increased 11.2% over the quarter.\n\nIn last quarter\u2019s report, we wrote about Uniswap\u2019s decision to implement the 0.01% fee tier as a boost for stablecoin trading volume. Analyzing the data above, Uniswap does appear to now be more competitive with Curve as a result of its enhanced capital efficiency.\n\nPrior to the launch of V3, Uniswap was doing a median of 8.54% of the combined volume between Uniswap and Curve. After the launch of V3, but prior to the implementation of the 0.01% fee tier, Uniswap stablecoin trading across both V2 and V3 operated at a median of 30\u201333% trading dominance. That median ratio now stands at 48.3% today, practically on parity with Curve. Uniswap\u2019s share of the two combined DEX\u2019s volume even reached a high of 71.4% on one day. Given the importance of stablecoins in the DeFi ecosystem, Uniswap\u2019s gains in this area are exciting to watch.\n\nWBTC/WETH\n\nTrading volume of the WBTC/WETH V3 pool fell 20.2% compared to Q4 2021. Notably, volume in the 0.05% pool fell 28.9% while volume in the higher 0.30% fee tier was mostly consistent across quarters. Liquidity in the smaller fee tier did jump 57.3% whereas the higher fee tier only moved up 13.7%. Since investor sentiment has noticeably cooled, some investors might be choosing to take a yield-generating LP position, earn fees on these (more stable) blue-chip assets, and re-evaluate the state of the market when better opportunities arise.\n\nBehind the scenes, Ethereum continues to show signs of losing its complete dominance of V3 trading. Over the last four quarters, the share of transaction activity occurring on Ethereum has gone from 100.0%, to 99.8%, to 98.4%, and finally, 96.4% in Q1 2022. Once again, the emergent winner in Q1 2022 continues to be Polygon. The WBTC/WETH protocol dominance level for Polygon shows the network starting at around 5% of all trading activity and peaking to 10% midway through the quarter. In total, the 3.6% gain by Polygon and other blockchains isn\u2019t earth-shattering, but it will be something to track as users continue to move towards cheaper scaling solutions.\n\nGrant Program\n\nUniswap approves grants almost every week, but to avoid publishing a blog post for each new funding, grants are batched together into waves. In Q1 2022, Uniswap released Wave 6 and Wave 7 of their Uniswap Grants Program. Note, the quarter in which batches become publicly shared does not necessarily correlate with the quarter they were made (i.e., some grants from the batches may have been funded in Q4 2021).\n\nWhat stands out from the quarter is the total grant funding distributed in Wave 6. The previous high occurred in Wave 5 with $946,000. Wave 6 was more than a 2.5x increase from this level, equating to $2.4 million of funding. More than $1 million was dedicated to the \u201cRFP and Challenge\u201d category. Some of the most notable grants from Wave 6 and Wave 7 are below:\n\nOther Internet (Governance Experiments) \u2013$1,000,000\n\nOther Internet received a $1 million grant from Uniswap Grants Program to further their research of Uniswap\u2019s open governance. In the summer of 2021, Other Internet completed initial research on the off-chain governance occurring in the protocol\u2019s Discord channels. The additional funding will support a series of action-oriented proposals to strengthen governance practices, many of which will ideally be implemented throughout crypto. Specific deliverables include a redesign of the governance process, a new committee for UGP, and insights into the protocol treasury. Money from this grant is expected to last the upcoming year.\n\nUnigrants Community Analytics Program \u2013 $250,000\n\nA quarter of a million dollars was set aside to fund winners of a new analytics-focused program. The objective of the program is to reward UNI token bounties to contributors who could produce analytics for the protocol. The purpose of the program is to use these analytics to further onboard new users into the community. A committee of five individuals, ranging from UGP members to independent analysts, were chosen to review applications and select bounty winners. More information about the Community Analytics Program can be found in the next section.\n\nTeam Secret \u2013 $112,500\n\nUniswap Grants Program decided to continue its partnership with Team Secret for the first half of the fiscal year 2022 after the team\u2019s top-three finish at The International, the biggest global DOTA tournament. As announced in June 2021, the partnership includes the team creating educational content around Uniswap and organizing future technology launches. The goal was \u2014 and continues to be \u2014 aimed toward reaching new audiences, especially those in the digitally native gaming community.\n\nArt Basel (Crypto Onboarding) \u2013 $68,500\n\nFunding was provided to set up a crypto booth at the upcoming Art Basel in December 2021. Occurring in Miami, the booth was dedicated to helping event attendees get onboarded with crypto. People were around to assist curious participants on setting up their first wallet, claiming their first event POAP, learning how to get into NFTs, and more. The end result saw over 300 people get onboarded into crypto and the DeFi ecosystem.\n\nCommunity Analytics Program\n\nAs stated prior, the Community Analytics program is designed to encourage more analytics for the growth of the Uniswap community. Multiple rounds of bounties have already occurred from the time the grant was approved till the end of Q1 2022.\n\nBounty #1: Uniswap on Polygon \u2014 Compare the deployment of Uniswap V3 to Polygon with its metrics on Ethereum. Include other DEXs in the analysis. The final product should display growth in a clean dashboard.\nBounty #2: Uniswap V3 LP Behavior \u2014 Create a dashboard analyzing LP behavior for Uniswap V3. Given the capital efficiency of the product, Uniswap wanted to better understand the fee tier, volume, and liquidity preferences of LPs.\nBounty #3: Uniswap V2 vs. V3 (L1) \u2013 Over any select time frame, provide analytics highlighting key metrics between the use of V2 compared to V3. V3 KPIs should be broken out by Layer-1 so Uniswap can better understand the drivers behind the adoption of its markets.\nBounty #4: Uniswap Governance \u2013 Study points of decentralization for Uniswap Governance, including all off-chain and on-chain voting procedures. This bounty was earned by selecting three specific data points and conducting an analysis of all relevant governance factors.\n\nThe Community Analytics Program will continue with Round 3, which is currently taking place. Submissions were due on April 1st, 2022. Winners will be announced one week later on April 8th.\n\nGovernance Updates\n\nFeb. 14, 2022 \u2014 Deploy Uniswap V3 on Harmony [Failed]\n\nThe decision to approve Hermes DeFi with a Uniswap V3 codebase use grant was rejected for not meeting quorum. The proposed idea would have allowed another alternative DEX to use Uniswap\u2019s code to create an AMM on Harmony. Uniswap would, in turn, receive a plethora of benefits, including Hermes token ownership, trading fees, a perpetual trading pool on the AMM, and more. The community\u2019s concerns centered on how this would not have been a native Uniswap app launch, compared to other \u201cDeploy Uniswap to XYZ Blockchain\u201d proposals. Since sentiment was mostly positive, however, the decision to launch on Harmony \u2014 either through a third party or natively \u2014 might potentially be revisited if a quorum can be met.\n\nFeb. 21, 2022 \u2014 Fund the Fee Switch Activation [Failed]\n\nUniswap\u2019s fee switch mechanism is a known topic of debate. At the heart of the question is when and how Uniswap will activate its famous fee switch to distribute protocol revenue to UNI token holders. This proposal offered to create a fund to oversee the application of the fee switch mechanism for both V2 and V3 pools but was rejected by the community.\n\nMarch 12, 2022 \u2014 Provide Voltz with Uniswap V3 Additional Use Grant\n\nProposed back in Q4, the decision to provide Voltz Protocol with the codebase use grant was successfully executed in March 2022. The codebase granted in this vote will be used for Voltz\u2019s new DeFi primitive for the trading of leveraged interest rate swaps. In return for approving this governance measure, Voltz has agreed to offer 1% of its token supply to Uniswap; if the protocol is successful in attracting liquidity, both Uniswap and Voltz stand to benefit.\n\nMarch 19, 2022 \u2014 Deploy Uniswap V3 on Celo\n\nA temperature check gauging interest in deploying V3 on the mobile-first, environment-focused Celo blockchain was passed in March 2022. Included in the proposal, if ultimately passed, will be $10 million in financial incentives, a third of which would be set aside for environmentally friendly assets such as tokenized carbon credits. By approving the temperature check, Uniswap and the Celo Foundation hope to move to a final vote shortly.\n\nMarch 25, 2022 \u2014 Deploy Uniswap to Gnosis Chain\n\nThe community voted to pass another temperature check regarding the deployment of Uniswap V3 to Gnosis Chain. Gnosis Chain recently underwent a rebranding effort from xDai Chain in an effort to grow usage of the network. Part of this proposal would include funding from the Gnosis Chain team in the form of $10 million from the Gnosis DAO ecosystem fund. Money received from the DAO will be allocated for a tailored liquidity mining program intended to attract users. A final vote should follow a similar timetable as the one needed to approve V3\u2019s launch on Celo.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nUniswap\u2019s first quarter of 2022 was primarily marked by organic growth on the Polygon network, exploring ways to expand V3 to other networks, and the pullback of overall trading across the larger crypto market. That last point is what community members may find concerning: if less trading activity occurs, won\u2019t that be detrimental to Uniswap?\n\nThe answer is a combination of yes and no. Exchanges always want to see healthy trading volume but the reality is Uniswap is well-positioned to deal with any correction in crypto markets. The fact users can enter into LP positions and earn yields suggests an engagement with the protocol will continue. Tracking how the protocol responds to a changing macro investment environment will be at top of mind for the rest of the year.\n\nThis report was commissioned by Uniswap Labs, a member of Protocol Services.

Gaming was the biggest loser as it started showing signs of weakening momentum last week. Last week it was the only sector with a negative return, and this week it took the heaviest losses at -13.28%. Web3 was the other category within sector returns that had a double-digit loss week, shedding 9.99%.\n\nTop Assets\n\nDogecoin (DOGE) was the only asset within the top 10 assets by market capitalization that ended the week with a positive return. The original dog coin went so far as reaching a 29% gain this week at $0.1796 but then giving most of it back, closing the week with a 4.5% return. Avalanche (AVAX) was the laggard of the group, ending the week with a 10.4% decline.\n\nDeFi Assets\n\nIt was a very different outcome for the DeFi sector this week compared to last week. Whereas it was the best-performing sector last week, it was among the bottom three this week. Even though the category\u2019s performance was not impressive this week, there was one asset that took the spotlight: Anchor Protocol\u2019s ANC token. The Terra-based lending and borrowing platform saw its token end the week with a 29.5% gain. Impressive considering the rest of the assets in the category finished the week in the red. THORChain (RUNE) was the biggest loser, marking a 17.3% loss for the week.\n\nSmart Contract Platforms\n\nNEAR Protocol stole Waves\u2019 (WAVES) thunder this week as the NEAR token closed with a 24.6% gain, eyeing to break all-time-highs. It was the only asset within the top smart contract platforms by market capitalization sector that ended the week with a positive return. The catalysts behind NEAR\u2019s recent rally are news of a $350 million funding round led by Tiger Global and rumors that NEAR will launch its native stablecoin (USN), an algorithmic stablecoin with a similar mechanism to Terra\u2019s UST and staking APY of 20%. TRON performed the worst within the category and took the last spot with a 13.7% loss.\n\nCurrencies\n\nOnly two currencies made it above water this week with Dogecoin (DOGE) leading the group and Monero (XMR) securing the second position. As mentioned earlier; Dogecoin\u2019s (DOGE) price went as high as 29% at $0.1796 before returning most of the gains. The dog token ended the week with a 4.5% return. The currencies that did not end the week in positive territory traded fairly close to each other throughout the week, closing within a 6.9% range (BTC at -4.9% and BCH at -11.8%).\n\nWeb3\n\nAudius (AUDIO) was the only winner within the Web3 sector this week with half of the assets in the category reporting double-digit losses. The decentralized music streaming platform has been gaining popularity recently, which has been contributing to its appreciation in price. The token saw its price rise as much as 58.7% before returning most of the gains. It was still enough to secure the number one spot with a 10.6% return. Theta (THETA) secured the endmost position with a 16.3% decline.\n\nGaming\n\nDvision Network was the clear outperformer of the gaming sector this week as the virtual reality content ecosystem\u2019s DVI token price rose as high as 54% at $0.5799 but subsequently returned most gains. The performance was enough to help keep its spot in the first place and finished the week with a 21.6% return. Axie Infinity enters its second week in a row where the AXS token comes in last, following the hack of its cross-chain bridge.\n\n", "references": [{"name": "Guillermo Avil\u00e9s", "url": ""}], "published_at": "2022-04-08T20:32:00Z", "author": {"name": "Guillermo Avil\u00e9s"}, "tags": null, "url": "https://messari.io/article/weekly-recap-ending-april-7"}, {"id": "c43613e4-3e80-47fd-8624-91bd4424ff22", "title": "Messari Employee Holdings Policy and Disclosures", "content": "Our Dedication to Transparency\n\nMessari\u2019s mission is to organize and curate critical information for crypto professionals.

SpookySwap would use the added capital to hire more developers and deepen BOO liquidity.  \n\nSector Returns\n\nThis week marks the third in a row where markets have seen a general positive return with the exception of the gaming sector. The DeFi sector was the best performer of the week, bringing in a return of 13.91%. Next up was the Web3 sector with a return of 10.27%. The gaming sector has been amongst the top performers for the past two weeks, securing multiple double-digit positive return weeks. This week saw a retracement for the sector as it was the only one to end the week on negative territory (-1.27%).\n\nTop Assets\n\nSolana (SOL) was the best performer amongst the top 10 assets by market capitalization this week, securing a 21.3% gain. Avalanche (AVAX) was the next best performer with an 11.4% return. Following closely was Terra (LUNA) which has continued its rally and now currently sits in ATH territory with a weekly return of 10.5%. Ripple\u2019s XRP performed the worst this week and was the only asset to end in a decline within the category (-3.2%).\n\nDeFi Assets\n\nIt has been an action-packed week for the DeFi space as the sector continues gaining momentum. Half of the top DeFi assets posted double-digit returns, with only one asset on the red. Leading the charge among the best-performing sector of the week was THORChain (RUNE) which brought a weekly return of 45.7%. The cross-chain liquidity protocol\u2019s asset has seen its price rise more than 277% since its February bottom. The second best performer was Aave (AAVE), which went on a rally following the release of V3, an upgrade that adds support to six blockchains. The lending and borrowing protocol ended the week with a 27.1% return. FRAX was the laggard of the group with a -1.5% return.\n\nSmart Contract Platforms\n\nWave\u2019s meteoric week comes from the back of three key events surrounding the Layer-1 blockchain. The first is the Waves 2.0 migration, the launch of a $150 million ecosystem fund and a partnership with Allbridge. However, critics have raised concerns regarding the sustainability of the ecosystem, pointing to the fact that the rise in interest in the blockchain was due to the rise in TVL, which was driven by Neutrino (an algorithmic price-stable \"assetization\" protocol built on top of Waves) buying up WAVES. Waves (WAVES) closed the week with a 155.0% gain. Cosmos (ATOM) took the last spot with a -3.2% loss.\n\nCurrencies\n\nThe top currencies sector posted the narrowest set of returns of the week, with returns within a 17.7% range. Leading the sector was Stellar (XLM) with a 10.2% return, the only asset within the category with a double-digit gain. Monero (XMR) was next up with a 4.2% return, followed by Bitcoin (BTC), returning 3.7% on the week. Zcash underperformed compared to the rest of the group, securing the last spot with a 7.5% loss.\n\nWeb3\n\nFilecoin (FIL) was on track to post a +35% return this week but at the last moment gave some of those returns back. It was enough to bring the open video infrastructure asset to compete with Theta Network (THETA) for the first spot. Filecoin ultimately secured the spot for the best performer with a 26.2% return while Theta Network (THETA) ended the week with a 23.9% return. Helium (HNT) took the last spot of the group with a -3.2% return.\n\nGaming\n\nSmooth Love Potion (SLP) was the best performer of the gaming sector this week, bringing in a 13.3% return for the week. Close by was Enjin (ENJ) which posted a weekly gain of 12.2%. Ultra (UOS) took the third spot with a 9.8% gain. Axie Infinity (AXS) took the last spot this week as it posted a loss of 11.9%, mainly driven by the news surrounding the Ronin bridge hack in one of the largest crypto exploits to date.\n\n", "references": [{"name": "Guillermo Avil\u00e9s", "url": ""}], "published_at": "2022-04-01T13:55:00Z", "author": {"name": "Guillermo Avil\u00e9s"}, "tags": ["Macro"], "url": "https://messari.io/article/weekly-recap-ending-march-31"}]}
